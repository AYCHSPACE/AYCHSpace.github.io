# Make it Easy to Install Emacs

“GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editor—and more.”

I wanted to invite novice hackers to check out [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). But installing Emacs for the first time isn't easy! Or rather: the installation can be easy, but finding the right package for your system may not be.

So I made [emacs.link](http://emacs.link/), a static site hosted with GitHub pages ([repo](https://github.com/ajschumacher/emacs.link)). It does a rough system detection and then presents simple, direct installation directions.

The directions are opinionated in that they only show one method per system:

 * On Linux you might want to build Emacs from source, but I don't mention that alternative.
 * On a Mac, you might prefer to install Emacs using [brew](http://brew.sh/), but if you don't have brew installed already it's easier to skip that step.
 * There's no Emacs installer for [Windows](http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/emacs/windows/README). The current directions may be too difficult for some Windows users.
 * There are ways to try to get Emacs running on [iOS](http://gamma-level.com/iphoneos/ports/emacs) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zielm.emacs), but I'm not sure that's even a good idea, so on mobile I recommend watching some fun [Emacs videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMoPuv-xXMM&index=6&list=UUkRmQ_G_NbdbCQMpALg6UPg).

I tried to make [emacs.link](http://emacs.link/) attractive, after the fashion of hip startup sites.

Thanks very much to her! I cropped and edited the original a little bit with [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/). As required, the edited version has the same license.
