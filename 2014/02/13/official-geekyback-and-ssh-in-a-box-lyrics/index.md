# Official GeekyBack and "SSH in a Box" Lyrics

<div>
<p>You may be familiar with Justin Timberlake's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOHvDP_vCs">SexyBack</a>...<br>

<p>GeekyBack</p>
<br>
I'm bringing geeky back.<br>
Those other newbs don't know how to hack<br>
If you're so 1337, why'd you buy a Mac?<br>
Sudo apt-get and I'll complete your stack.<br>
<br>
load 'em to the cache...<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
Dirty data<br>
You see I've tackled<br>
unicode in waves.<br>
I'd keep you open if you'd only save.<br>
It's just that no one hexed in ASA.<br>
<br>
Get your hexy on<br>
Go ahead be coding<br>
[Repeat 6 times]<br>
<br>
Get your hexy on<br>
<br>
I'm bringing geeky back<br>
Them other ... don't know how to hack<br>
Come let me pyparse all up in your stack.<br>
'Cause your regex sucks I gotta fix it fast.<br>
<br>
load 'em to the cache...<br>
[Bridge]<br>
<br>
I'm bringing hexy back<br>
You subpar hackers watch my grep attack.<br>
If that's your URL you best urlparse a path<br>
'Cause your punctuation is all outta whack.<br>
<br>
Take 'em to the meetup<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Come here URL<br>
Go ahead be coding<br>
come for the hack<br>
Go ahead be coding<br>
S-E-D<br>
Go ahead be coding<br>
Scripts in C?<br>

<p>SSH in a Box</p>
<br>
Not gonna mail you a cleartext string<br>
Cause creds like that don't hide anything.<br>
Not gonna force another RSA start<br>
Girl you're gotta learn more than wi-re-shark.<br>
<br>
Not gonna default you to homelessville<br>
Cause a password like that is the kind they steal.<br>
Wanna MD5 you to a UPC code<br>
Somethin' unique, girl.<br>
<br>
It's ssh in a box<br>
ssh in a box, babe<br>
It's ssh in a box<br>
Ooh, ssh in a box, girl<br>
<br>
I'm secure enough to know<br>
You need encryption, and I got just the key,<br>
A two factor key--that's right--a second plus one.<br>
<br>
To all the admins out there with users to protect<br>
It's easy to do just follow these steps...<br>
<br>
Step 1, apt-get on that box<br>
Step 2, open ports on that box<br>
Step 3, ssh to that box<br>
And that's the way you do it<br>
<br>
It's ssh in a box!<br>
