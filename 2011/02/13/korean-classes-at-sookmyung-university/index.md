# Korean classes at Sookmyung University, Saturdays 3-5pm

<div>
<p>I can't believe I didn't find out about these classes earlier. &#160;They have something like five levels, with really decent books that they make themselves, and the cost is just 1,000 won, aka basically free (maybe an extra 1,000 won when you first get your book). &#160;You can just show up and walk in any Saturday you want. &#160;The teachers are students at the university, so they're not trained like professors or anything, but they're cool and they run the classes as a sort of club activity. &#160;They also organize other events for people learning Korean from time to time, as I understand it. &#160;By far the best free/cheap Korean class I've encountered.<br><br>TIME: 3:00 - 5:00pm EVERY SATURDAY<br>LOCATION: Sookmyung Women's University<br><br>HOW TO GET THERE:<br>Go to <b>Sookmyung Women's University Station (&#49689;&#45824;&#51077;&#44396;&#50669;)</b> on line 4. &#160;Exit through <b>exit number 9 (nine)</b>. &#160;Go straight and then take the <b>first possible right</b>, which will be a smallish street. &#160;You'll go through a little tunnel thing, an underpass or whatever, and then cross a bigger street. &#160;Continue going <b>straight</b>, past cafes and so on. &#160;It won't be quite ten minutes walking, I think, and the <b>university</b> will loom <b>on your left</b>. &#160;Referring to the picture: go up the first set of <b>stairs</b>, then go up one of the next sets of <b>stairs</b>. Head for that corner in the back there. &#160;You can go a little ways to the <b>right</b> there, and the building will be on your <b>left</b>. &#160;You'll see people in the lobby organizing things, and you can talk to them to "pay" and get a book and head to class! &#160;Get there a little before three so you can get to the right place on time!<br><br></p>
