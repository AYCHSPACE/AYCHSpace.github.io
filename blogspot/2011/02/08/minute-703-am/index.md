<p>Minute 7:03 AM</p>
<p>There wasn't any reason to get up quickly today, was there? If a<br>question is directed to no one in particular, it's hard to expect an<br>answer.</p>
<p>In his latest contortion, a new creature awakens within Aaron, like a<br>life form from a Jovian planet. It crawls along just a bit, and is<br>finally expelled with a sound like wind over dry leaves. Internal<br>pressure is re-normalized.</p>
<p>Another question appears in Aaron's mind, like the last one, just<br>nerves firing in a lonely part of the skull, nobody to hear them. An<br>old, unattributed quote: "If God is so smart, then why do we fart?"</p>
