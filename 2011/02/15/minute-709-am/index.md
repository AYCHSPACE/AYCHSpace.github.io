<p>Minute 7:09 AM</p>
<p>It's not all hyperinflation racing mega-debt for future Aaron. Past<br>Aaron took the bedside table from his old apartment, so that's<br>positive inheritance, and maybe theft. The top drawer is full of<br>coins, every day, heavier and heavier, it's a pirate treasure four<br>floors above ground. It'll be fun to take to the bank one day, but it<br>won't be one month's rent, won't be one plane ticket. It'll be heavy.<br>Maybe the trip to the bank will be memorable. There's luggage in the<br>corner there, that mostly sits these days. Two summers in a row<br>through Europe; how did past Aaron manage that, and why? Why doesn't<br>he feel the urge to travel any more? For the past few years it's been<br>travel as a matter of course, or routine routes to disappointing<br>destinations. Sleep, sleep, sleep.</p>
