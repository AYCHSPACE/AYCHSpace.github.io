Hi! I'm Aaron. This is my blog and [my twitter handle](https://twitter.com/planarrowspace). You can get from one to the other. [This presentation](big.html) and a corresponding write-up (you're reading it) are on my blog (which you're on).

Here's what Go sometimes looked like in [Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_(film)).

-----

Go really looks more like this. It's a game, see?


-----

![game AIs on xkcd](img/game_ais.png)

-----

[xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) had this [cartoon](https://xkcd.com/1002/) about game AIs and Go was on it.

Go was supposed to be hard for computers to be good at.

But... [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/).


-----

TWO THINGS

-----

First technically interesting things, and then a personally interesting thing.


-----

![nets](img/nets.png)

-----

Neural nets! Policy networks! Value networks!

Interesting, but/and I do that kind of thing for work.

me: 0

computer: ∞

-----

The other thing is that I suck at Go, so I don't need/want a Go computer to be so spanking good.
