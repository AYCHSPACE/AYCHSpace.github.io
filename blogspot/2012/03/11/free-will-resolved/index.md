# Free Will Resolved

<div>
<p>The universe has helped me out considerably by having <a href="http://www.samharris.org/">Sam Harris</a> write <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Free-Will-Sam-Harris/dp/1451683405">this book called Free Will</a>, which saves me time since now I don't have to write it but I can still direct people to a book that explains my views on the matter. Hurrah!<br><br>I don't think that it's perfectly written, but it isn't awful, and I think the average reader should be able to understand the meaning from it, which is something. Of course it's all correct. Perhaps my favorite quote:<br></p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">"You are not controlling the storm, and you are not lost in it. You are the storm."</blockquote>
<br>Summary of the whole argument: Doing what you want and therefore choose is not what we usually think of as free will, because you don't choose what you will want in the first place.<br><br>Let us go forth, living more freely, having thrown off the shackles of free will!</div>
