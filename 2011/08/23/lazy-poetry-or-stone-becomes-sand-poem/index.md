# lazy poetry (or) stone becomes sand (a poem)

<div>
<p>we pass so many u-haul trucks</p>
<div>on our darkened streets</div>
<div>that I am filled with an overwhelming sense</div>
<div>of the constant ending and starting of the universe</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>it is the feeling of having such a strong emotion with no name</div>
<div>that the stale sunset's wake overcomes us and everything is poetry</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>u-haul trucks line the dark streets of my alma mater</div>
<div>separating students from the roads that brought them there</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>cycles cycles</div>
<div>bicycles</div>
<div>motorcycles</div>
<div>cidadas</div>
<div>and poetry no more has to rhyme</div>
<div>than rocks thrown through windows</div>
<div>are required to have notes</div>
<div>to explain themselves</div>
<div>sapir-whorf</div>
<div>star trek</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>"oowoop" are you okay?</div>
<div>I just made a strange sound</div>
<div>and I am concerned that everything is poetry</div>
<div>or something might not be</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>seen through windows</div>
<div>hands take bowls from cabinets</div>
<div>hands put bowls into cabinets</div>
<div>and the cabinets are not the same</div>
<div>but love for them remains</div>
</div>
