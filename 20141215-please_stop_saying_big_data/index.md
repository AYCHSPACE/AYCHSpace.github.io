# Size and Complexity in Real Data Systems


*A short talk for [AIR](http://www.air.org/).*

A friend from the Midwest got in touch with me recently to get my address for a Christmas card. We got to talking, and I told her that I was going to give a talk about big data. She asked me, "What's big about it?"

I think that's a fair question. I think it's fair to expect that simple words should combine in reasonable ways.

“Big Cars”

Let's talk about “Big Cars” for a minute. Everyone knows what big cars are. Let's see if “[the four V's of big data](http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/infographic/four-vs-big-data)” make sense for cars.

 * Volume: Do big cars have big volume? Yes. This one makes sense. We might care about how that volume is arranged, but if it's big it's big.
 * Velocity: Are big cars moving, possibly quickly? Well, maybe they are, maybe they aren't. Big cars can be standing still, and fast cars can be small.
 * Variety: Are big cars of many different types? This is clearly a big deal to a mechanic, but again, size and variety are not necessarily related.
 * Veracity: What does this even mean? “Is it a real Hummer?” But more importantly: Do we care more about this for big cars than small cars?

The good news here is that the leaders of the field agree with your average Midwesterner about what “big” ought to mean, and I'll get to that.

Gartner's [hype cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle) is a cartoonish way of trying to understand the world. Like many cartoonish ways of trying to understand the world, it can be very helpful.

I'm going to take you through the “trough of disillusionment,” up the “slope of enlightenment,” and talk about what work generally looks like on the “plateau of productivity.”

My objective is to cut “Big Data” down to size for you. I want to keep things concrete with examples. My thesis is that more than any particular technology or technique, we need better-engineered and open systems. I will tell you to learn Python.

[Alan Kay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTAghAJcO1o) earlier this year which included this:

> Big data is a way that a lot of people are trying to make money today. And it's a favorite of marketing people, because it's in the wind. Everybody has heard the phrase “big data.” Not everybody knows what it means. And so it's the perfect context for doing things that people can say, “Well this is an application of big data and this is an application of big data.” But in fact, the interesting future's not about data at all - it's about meaning.
