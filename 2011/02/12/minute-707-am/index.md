# Minute 7:07 AM

<p>Minute 7:07 AM</p>
<p>There goes the alarm, right on time, as synchronized across the phone<br>network. The sound of vibration is actually louder than the alarm<br>sound itself, somehow.</p>
<p>Night Aaron set the phone alarm for seven minutes after the clock<br>alarm, with the idea that attempts to jar morning Aaron into<br>consciousness would be wasted if they can all be extinguished in the<br>same sweep of an arm.</p>
<p>Now the phone's screen is glowing, an amazing feet of modern<br>engineering. The phone is more powerful than the first four computers<br>Aaron ever used, even combined. All that power, to pop up a little<br>blue box that says "Snooze."</p>
<p>Morning Aaron pulls himself up just enough to throw an arm across the<br>chasm of floor, and gently tap "Okay." His mind is gone again on the<br>way back down to the pillow.</p>
