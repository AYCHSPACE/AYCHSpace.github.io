just collecting some old notes here; no need to mess with all of the
possible python stuff right now


actually not sure these are good enough versions; kind of annoying

https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/python/requirements.txt

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib \
    cython ipython python-networkx python-pandas python-gflags \
    python-nose python-protobuf python-leveldb python-h5py \
    python-skimage python-dateutil python-yaml python-setuptools \
    python-pip
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install libtiff4-dev libjpeg8-dev zlib1g-dev \
    libfreetype6-dev liblcms2-dev libwebp-dev tcl8.5-dev tk8.5-dev
```

BUT I GUESS PILLOW IS ALREADY INSTALLED, BECAUSE `sudo pip install
Pillow` says it's already there?
