# Boomerang by Michael Lewis

Michael Lewis wrote [Moneyball](https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818) and [The Big Short](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Short-Inside-Doomsday-Machine/dp/0393338827). He also wrote [Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World](https://www.amazon.com/Boomerang-Travels-New-Third-World/dp/0393343448), made up of essays published first in [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/), 2009-2011.

Each chapter focuses on one country:

1. Iceland: dumb young male chauvinist bankers defaulted internationally
2. Greece: dumb male chauvinist everyone stole, defaulted, lied; also monks are there
3. Ireland: dumb young male chauvinist bankers defaulted on Irish real estate
4. Germany: best economy in Europe, still pretty dumb; also lots about poop
5. USA: cities promised pensions for cops and firefighters; cities now all bankrupt

There's a preface with the big shorter from The Big Short, who says that he got himself a million dollars worth of nickels and recommends investing in guns and gold.

Lots of people, cities, banks, and countries are in a lot of debt, which could be bad.
