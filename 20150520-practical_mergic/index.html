<p>Hi! I'm Aaron. This is my blog and <a href="https://twitter.com/planarrowspace">my twitter handle</a>. You can get from one to the other. <a href="big.html">This presentation</a> and a corresponding write-up (you're reading it) are on my blog (which you're on).</p>

<p><em><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tweed_Courthouse_north_main_facade_118443pv.jpg">Image from Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>
<p>The first time I wrote software to address this problem, I was working for the New York City Department of Education, in Tweed Courthouse.</p>
<p>The NYC DOE had unique IDs for every student, and for every teacher, but did not have unique IDs for principals, at least not in every data system at that time. This made sense, because there are only about sixteen hundred New York City public schools.</p>
<p>Those of you who have experience with humans will recall that names are not unique IDs. People change their names, or add titles like “PhD”, or have their names differently at different times for no good reason. In the case of principals, sometimes they even switch schools and change their names <em>at the same time</em>.</p>
<p>In a situation like this, an approximate solution is not acceptable. The DOE makes some decisions based on data, God bless them.</p>
<p>I had to get a perfect matching of all these principals' names, so I wrote some code to help speed the process. I still had to verify proposed pairs, and it was awful, and it was a long time ago, and I wished there was a better way to do it.</p>
<p>My primary concerns were, and are, to speed up the de-duplication process while allowing editing by hand and still being reproducible and easily auditable by humans.</p>
<p>I've developed a process, or workflow, that I think is pretty good, and I've written a new tool to help with this process.</p>
<p>I've also learned about some of the ecosystem of techniques and tools available, and I'll talk about these as well.</p>
<p>I'll finish by suggesting that we probably need to do something entirely different.</p>
<p>I've thought about this issue a little bit, but more than issuing a report I'd like to encourage a discussion that might lead to more and better work with data.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“There are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><a href="http://www.meerkat.com/karlton/">Phil Karlton</a> <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html">said</a> that “There are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things.”</p>
<p>When working with data (let's call it “data science” then, instead of “computer science”) you have problems not only with your own names, but also with everybody else's names.</p>
<p>It's just semantics, I suppose.</p>
<hr />
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<hr />
<p>이름이란 것은 정말 중요합니다. 예를 들면, 미국에서 한국말로...</p>
<p>My Korean isn't that good. What I'm trying to say here is that agreeing on names is important, and the issue is a big one.</p>
<p>Maintaining a practical focus, let's focus on just two classes of problems:</p>
<hr />
<p>when names are the same</p>
<hr />
<p>Lots of things can go wrong when names are re-used when they shouldn't be.</p>
<hr />
<p>when names aren't the same</p>
<hr />
<p>It can be even worse when names for the same thing are <em>not</em> the same.</p>
<p>Both these problems are closely related to merging, and we'll think a lot about that context.</p>
<p>But first, an example illustrating the importance of checking that your names are unique (not the same).</p>
<hr />
<p>demo: kinds of boys</p>
<hr />
<p>The <a href="SchoolMathResults20062012Public.xlsx">Excel file here</a> was <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/A77DF9C5-BD62-4171-9995-4EB41E7E4067/0/SchoolMathResults20062012Public.xlsx">downloaded</a> from the <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/exeres/05289E74-2D81-4CC0-81F6-E1143E28F4C4,frameless.htm">NYC DOE site</a>. It contains standardized test results for New York City schools for individual grades and other sub-groups. We'll use two sheets that have been saved as CSV (originally for my <a href="http://planspace.org/2014/01/07/clean-data-with-r/">Clean Data with R</a> talk), <code>gender.csv</code> and <code>all.csv</code>. The R script itself is in <a href="check_unique.R">check_unique.R</a>.</p>
<p>There's a little setup to make reading the data easier.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">library("dplyr")

read.doe &lt;- function(filename) {
  data &lt;- read.csv(filename, as.is=TRUE,
                   skip=6, check.names=FALSE,
                   na.strings="s")
  stopifnot(names(data) == c("DBN", "Grade", "Year", "Category",
                             "Number Tested","Mean Scale Score",
                             "#","%","#","%","#","%","#","%","#","%"))
  names(data) &lt;- c("dbn", "grade", "year", "category",
                   "num_tested", "mean_score",
                   "num1", "per1", "num2", "per2", "num3", "per3", "num4", "per4",
                   "num34", "per34")
 return(tbl_df(data))
}</code></pre>

<p>Now we can start looking at the data, using <a href="https://github.com/hadley/dplyr">dplyr</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">gender &lt;- read.doe("gender.csv")

<p>What's our unique key for this data set? It looks like it should be <code>dbn</code> (a unique identifier for a school), <code>grade</code>, <code>year</code>, and <code>category</code>. Let's check. The following should be zero if there are no duplicates.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">gender %>%
  select(dbn, grade, year, category) %>%
  duplicated %>%
  sum
## [1] 1421</code></pre>

<p>Shocking! Seeing that there are duplicates doesn't yet tell us how the duplicates are distributed; is it 1,422 copies of the same combination, or something else?</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">gender %>%
  group_by(dbn, grade, year, category) %>%
  summarize(n=n()) %>%
  group_by(n) %>%
  summarize(count=n())
## Source: local data frame [2 x 2]
##
##   n count
## 1 1 65186
## 2 2  1421</code></pre>

<p>Much like using <code>table</code>, now we can see that most key combinations appear just once, but 1,421 appear twice. Interesting! Let's look at them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">gender %>%
  group_by(dbn, grade, year, category) %>%

<p>Looks like there are two different kinds of males! How strange! Can we see what's going on by looking at the rest of the file?</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">gender %>%
  filter(dbn=='01M019', year==2010, grade==3)

<p>Unfortunately not; we'll have to look at additional data to try to determine what's going on. (This is typical.)</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">all_students &lt;- read.doe("all.csv")
data &lt;- bind_rows(all_students, gender)

data %>%
  filter(dbn=='01M019', year==2010, grade==3)

## 2 01M019     3 2010       Female         16        687    0  0.0    9 56.3

<p>It looks like these extra males aren't being counted in the total for “All Students”, so maybe we can drop them. Or maybe the “All Students” total is wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This happens. This is a thing that happens.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a scene from a movie called Magnolia when it's raining frogs. One of the things they say in that movie is that strange things happen, and if you've worked with any variety of data sets, you've probably encountered very strange things. You need to check everything—including things that you shouldn’t have to check.</p>
<hr />
<p>merge</p>
<hr />
<p>One big reason to want nice unique IDs is that you would like to merge two data sets, and you need something to match records by. Let's do a quick refresher on merging, or joining.</p>
<hr />
<p><img height="1000%" title="dplyr cheat sheet joins" src="dplyr_joins.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>This is a section from <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>'s <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/">cheatsheet</a> for <a href="https://github.com/hadley/dplyr">dplyr</a>. These cheatsheets are fantastic.</p>
<p>We'll do a merge between two data sets. For simplicity say that they have one column which is an identifier for each row, and some data in other columns. There are a couple ways we can join the data.</p>
<p>Some people like to think about these in terms of Venn diagrams.</p>
<hr />
<p><img width="1000%" title="left join" src="left_join.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>This picture comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/codinghorror">Jeff Atwood</a>'s post called <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/">visual explanation of SQL joins</a>.</p>
<p>A former co-worker told me that seeing these pictures changed his life. I hope you like them.</p>
<p>This is a left join: you get all the keys from the left data set, regardless of whether they're in the right data set.</p>
<hr />
<p><img width="1000%" title="right join" src="right_join.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Jeff Atwood doesn't have a picture of a right join on his blog, but you can make one with a little <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">convert -rotate 180 left_join.png right_join.png</code></pre>

<p>You're welcome.</p>
<hr />
<p><img width="1000%" title="inner join" src="inner_join.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>An inner join, or natural join, only gives you results for keys that appear in both the left and right data sets.</p>
<hr />
<p><img width="1000%" title="outer join" src="outer_join.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>And an outer join gives you everything. Great!</p>
<p>There are a few other terms we could add, but let's not.</p>
<hr />
<p><img height="1000%" title="dplyr cheat sheet joins" src="dplyr_joins.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Here's the <code>dplyr</code> summary again. You can see how you can introduce missing values when doing left, right, and outer joins.</p>
<p>Ready? Here's a test.</p>
<hr />
<p>How many rows do you get when you outer join two tables?</p>
<hr />
<p>Think about this question, discuss it with somebody near you, come up with everything you can say about the number of rows you might expect when you join two tables. Introduce any quantities you think you'd like to know.</p>
<p>Take about three minutes and then come back.</p>
<p><em>three minutes pass</em></p>
<p>Say there are <em>N</em> rows in the first table and <em>M</em> rows in the second table. Then the smallest number of rows we can get from the outer join is the greater of <em>N</em> and <em>M</em>. But we might get as many as <em>N * M</em> rows, if all the keys are the same!</p>
<p>If you said the maximum was <em>N + M</em>, you were probably assuming, implicitly or explicitly, that all they keys were unique. This is a common assumption that you should really check.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-r">> nrow(first)
## [1] 3
> nrow(second)
## [1] 3
> result &lt;- merge(first, second)
> nrow(result)
## [1] 3</code></pre>

<hr />
<p><em>This code is runnable in <a href="count_trouble.R">count_trouble.R</a>.</em></p>
<p>Is it enough to check the numbers of rows when we do joins?</p>
<p>This does an inner join, which is the default for <code>merge</code> in R.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-text"> x    y1        x   y2        x    y1   y2
 1 looks        1 good        1 looks good
 2    oh        2  boy        2    oh  boy
 3  well        2   no        2    oh   no</code></pre>

<hr />
<p>There is no peace while you don't have unique IDs.</p>
<p>There are times when you don't want every ID to be unique in a table, but really really often you do. You probably want to check that uniqueness explicitly.</p>
<hr />
<p>when names are the same</p>
<hr />
<p>This has been a discussion of problems arising from names being the same.</p>
<hr />
<p>when names aren't the same</p>
<hr />
<p>Probably also want to check that the intersection you get is what you expect.</p>
<p>You don't want to silently drop a ton of rows when you merge!</p>
<p>This is the beginning of our problems with names that aren't the same.</p>
<hr />
<p>demo: let's play tennis</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Here begins material also present in <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/mergic/tree/master/tennis">ajschumacher/mergic:tennis</a>.</em></p>
<p>Download the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Tennis+Major+Tournament+Match+Statistics">Tennis Major Tournament Match Statistics Data Set</a> from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a> into an empty directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ wget https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00300/Tennis-Major-Tournaments-Match-Statistics.zip</code></pre>

<p>This file should be stable, but it's also included <a href="Tennis-Major-Tournaments-Match-Statistics.zip">here</a> and/or you can verify that its <code>md5</code> is <code>e9238389e4de42ecf2daf425532ce230</code>.</p>
<p>Unpack eight CSV files from the <code>Tennis-Major-Tournaments-Match-Statistics.zip</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ unzip Tennis-Major-Tournaments-Match-Statistics.zip</code></pre>

<p>You should see that the first two columns of each file contain player names, though the column names are not consistent. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ head -2 AusOpen-women-2013.csv | cut -c 1-40
## Player1,Player2,Round,Result,FNL1,FNL2,F
## Serena Williams,Ashleigh Barty,1,1,2,0,5

$ head -2 USOpen-women-2013.csv | cut -c 1-40
## Player 1,Player 2,ROUND,Result,FNL.1,FNL
## S Williams,V Azarenka,7,1,2,1,57,44,43,2</code></pre>

<p>Make a <code>names.txt</code> with all the names that appear:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ for filename in *2013.csv
do
    for field in 1 2
    do
        tail +2 $filename | cut -d, -f$field >> names.txt
    done
done</code></pre>

<p>Now you have a file with 1,886 lines, each one of 669 unique strings, as you can verify:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ wc -l names.txt
## 1886

$ sort names.txt | uniq | wc -l
## 669</code></pre>

<p>There are too many unique strings—sometimes more than one string for the same player. As a result, a count of the most common names will not accurately tell us who played the most in these 2013 tennis competitions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sort names.txt | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
##  21 Rafael Nadal
##  17 Stanislas Wawrinka
##  17 Novak Djokovic
##  17 David Ferrer
##  15 Roger Federer
##  14 Tommy Robredo
##  13 Richard Gasquet
##  11 Victoria Azarenka
##  11 Tomas Berdych
##  11 Serena Williams</code></pre>

<p>The list above is not the answer we’re looking for. We want to be correct.</p>
<hr />
<p>single field de-duplication</p>
<hr />
<p>We're going to think about this problem, which is pretty common, of de-duplicating (or making a merge table for) a single text field.</p>

<p><em>Here begins material also presented in a <a href="/20150514-mergic/">lightning talk</a> at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PyDataNYC/events/222329250/">May meeting</a> (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/event-registration/?id=39288">registration</a>) of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PyDataNYC/">PyData NYC meetup group</a>.</em></p>
<p>To be clear, the problem looks like this. And the problem often looks like this: You have either two columns with slightly different versions of identifiers, or one long list of things that you need to resolve to common names. These problems are fundamentally the same.</p>
<p>Do you see the match here? (It's Santiago!)</p>
<p>So we need to find the strings that refer to the same person.</p>

<p>demo: Open Refine</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="http://openrefine.org/">Open Refine</a> is quite good.</p>
<p>An interesting side story is that Open Refine was formerly Google Refine, and before that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaweb">Metaweb</a>'s “Freebase Gridworks”. Google is shutting down <a href="http://www.freebase.com/">Freebase</a>, and we have to hope that <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a> will then be the open match for Google's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph">Knowledge Graph</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/jqnatividad">Joel Natividad</a> for pointing out an <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/983">interesting algorithmic development</a> connected with ongoing work on Open Refine.</p>
<p>Steps of simple Open Refine demo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start the Open Refine app</li>
<li>Browse to <a href="http://localhost:3333/">http://localhost:3333/</a></li>
<li>Click “Create Project”</li>
<li>Click “Choose Files”</li>
<li>Select <code>names.txt</code></li>
<li>Click “Next »“</li>
<li>Click “Create Project »”</li>
<li>Click the down arrow next to “Column 1”, then follow “Edit cells” to “Cluster and edit…”</li>
</ul>
<p><img width="1000%" title="Open Refine" src="open_refine.png" /></p>
<p>Open Refine has <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Clustering">introductory</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Clustering-In-Depth">in-depth</a> documentation about their “clustering” mechanisms.</p>
<p>In this interface, we can use “key collision” or “nearest neighbor” methods.</p>
<p>The “key collision” method maps every value to one “key”, and items are identical if they have the same key. This allows us to avoid calculating anything for all pairs. (This should remind you of hashing.)</p>
<p>There are four “keying functions” in Open Refine:</p>
<ul>
<li>“fingerprint” standardizes a string by case and punctuation.</li>
<li>“ngram-fingerprint” standardizes a bit further, using character ngrams.</li>
<li>“metaphone3” standardizes by the phonetic <a href="http://www.amorphics.com/">Metaphone 3</a> algorithm so that things that sound the same in English should be keyed together. (There are strange licensing issues around Metaphone 3.)</li>
<li>“cologne-phonetic” standardizes by the <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6lner_Phonetik">Kölner Phonetik</a> algorithm so that things that sound the same in German should be keyed together. (There is a <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-codec/apidocs/org/apache/commons/codec/language/ColognePhonetic.html">real open source version</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The “nearest neighbor” method calculates pairwise distances, which is slow. Open Refine uses blocking to break things up into blocks that it won’t compare across, which reduces the number of comparisons to improve speed of calculation.</p>
<p>There are two “distance functions” in Open Refine:</p>
<ul>
<li>“levenshtein” is the well-known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein edit distance</a></li>
<li>“PPM” estimates how different strings are by how well they compress separately versus together, using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_by_partial_matching">Prediction by Partial Matching</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The “radius” is the distance below which two items will be clustered together. With a higher value for “radius”, groups will tend to be larger.</p>
<p><a href="http://openrefine.org/">Open Refine</a> is quite good, but there are several things I would like:</p>
<ul>
<li>See all the items rather than just the ones being grouped.</li>
<li>Customize / break up groupings that are incorrect, while preserving others.</li>
<li>Easily use a custom distance function.</li>
<li>Easily use a custom function for choosing the “New Cell Value”.</li>
<li>See what would happen with different “radii” without trying them all.</li>
<li>Have a record of the whole transformation that’s easy to review, edit, and reapply.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><img height="1000%" title="ermahgerd mergic" src="ermahgerd.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>So I made <code>mergic</code>.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>simple</li>
<li>customizable</li>
<li>reproducible</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>The goals of <code>mergic</code> are to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple, meaning largely text-based and obvious; the tool disappears</li>
<li>customizable, meaning you can easily use a custom distance function</li>
<li>reproducible, meaning everything you do can be done again automatically</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>the tool disappears</p>
<hr />
<p>Good tools disappear.</p>
<p>Whatever text editor you use, the your work product is a text file. You can use any text editor, or use different ones for different purposes, and so on.</p>
<p>Your merge process shouldn't rely on any particular piece of software for its replicability.</p>
<hr />
<p>any distance function</p>
<hr />
<p>Your distance function can make all the difference. You need to be able to plug in any distance function that works well for your data.</p>
<hr />
<p>really reproducible</p>
<hr />
<p>People can see what's happening, and computers can keep doing the process without clicking or re-running particular executables.</p>

<p>demo: mergic tennis</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="language-bash">pew new pydata</code></pre>

<p>I'll start by making a new <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/">virtual environment</a> using <a href="https://github.com/berdario/pew">pew</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install mergic</code></pre>

<p><code>mergic</code> is very new (version 0.0.4.1) and it currently installs with no extra dependencies.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mergic -h</code></pre>

<p><code>mergic</code> includes a command-line script based on <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html">argparse</a> that uses a default string distance function.</p>
<pre><code>usage: mergic [-h] {calc,make,check,diff,apply,table} ...

positional arguments:
  {calc,make,check,diff,apply,table}
    calc                calculate all partitions of data
    make                make a JSON partition from data
    check               check validity of JSON partition
    diff                diff two JSON partitions
    apply               apply a patch to a JSON partition
    table               make merge table from JSON partition

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit</code></pre>

<p>The list above is not the answer we’re looking for. We want to be correct.</p>
<p>In the tennis data, names appear sometimes with full first names and sometimes with only first initials. To get good comparisons, we should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transform all the data to the same format, as nearly as possible.</li>
<li>Use a good distance on the transformed data.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do both of these things in our custom script, <a href="tennis_mergic.py">tennis_mergic.py</a>. It only <a href="requirements.txt">requires</a> the <code>mergic</code> and <code>python-Levenshtein</code> packages.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python

import re
import Levenshtein
import mergic


def first_initial_last(name):
    initial = re.match("^[A-Z]", name).group()
    last = re.search("(?&lt;=[ .])[A-Z].+$", name).group()
    return "{}. {}".format(initial, last)


def distance(x, y):
    x = first_initial_last(x)
    y = first_initial_last(y)
    return Levenshtein.distance(x, y)


mergic.Blender(distance).script()</code></pre>

<p>Now <a href="tennis_mergic.py">tennis_mergic.py</a> can be used just like the standard <code>mergic</code> script.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ./tennis_mergic.py calc names.txt
## num groups, max group, num pairs, cutoff
## ----------------------------------------
##        669,         1,         0, -1
##        358,         5,       384, 0
##        348,         6,       414, 1
##        332,         6,       470, 2
##        262,        85,      5117, 3
##        165,       324,     52611, 4
##         86,       496,    122899, 5
##         46,       584,    170287, 6
##         24,       624,    194407, 7
##         16,       641,    205138, 8

##          4,       663,    219459, 10
##          2,       668,    222778, 11
##          1,       669,    223446, 12</code></pre>

<p>There is a clear best cutoff here, as the size of the max group jumps from 6 items to 85 and the number of within-group comparisons jumps from 470 to 5,117. So we create a partition where the Levenshtein distance between names in our standard first initial and last name format is no more than two, and put the result in a file called <code>groups.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ./tennis_mergic.py make names.txt 2 > groups.json</code></pre>

<p>As expected, the proposed grouping has combined things over-zealously in some places:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ head -5 groups.json
## {
##     "Yen-Hsun Lu": [
##         "Di Wu",
##         "Yen-Hsun Lu",
##         "Y-H.Lu",</code></pre>

<p>Manual editing can produce a corrected version of the original grouping, which could be saved as <code>edited.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ head -8 edited.json
## {
##     "Yen-Hsun Lu": [
##         "Yen-Hsun Lu",
##         "Y-H.Lu"
##     ],
##     "Di Wu": [
##         "Di Wu"
##     ],</code></pre>

<p>Parts of the review process would be difficult or impossible for a computer to do accurately.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are the Plíšková twins, Karolína and Kristýna. When we see that <code>K Pliskova</code> appears, we have to go back and see that this occurred in the <code>USOpen-women-2013.csv</code> file, and only Karolína played in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_US_Open_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_Singles">2013 US Open</a>.</li>
<li>In a similar but less interesting way, <code>B.Becker</code> turns out to refer to Benjamin, not Brian.</li>
<li>An <code>A Wozniak</code> appears with <code>C Wozniack</code> and <code>C Wozniacki</code>. The first initial does turn out to differentiate the Canadian from the Dane.</li>
<li>The name <code>A.Kuznetsov</code> refers to <em>both</em> Andrey <em>and</em> Alex in <code>Wimbledon-men-2013.csv</code>. This can't be resolved by <code>mergic</code>. One way to resolve the issues is to edit <code>Wimbledon-men-2013.csv</code> so that <code>A.Kuznetsov,I.Sijsling</code> becomes <code>Alex Kuznetsov,I.Sijsling</code>, based on checking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Wimbledon_Championships_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles">records from that competition</a>.</li>
<li><code>Juan Martin Del Potro</code> is unfortunately too different from <code>J.Del Potro</code> in the current formulation to be grouped automatically, but a human reviewer can correct this. Similarly for <code>Anna Schmiedlova</code> and <code>Anna Karolina Schmiedlova</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After editing, you can check that the new grouping is still valid. At this stage we aren't using anything custom any more, so the default <code>mergic</code> is fine:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mergic check partition_edited.json
## 669 items in 354 groups</code></pre>

<p>The <code>mergic</code> diffing tools make it easy to make comparisons that would otherwise be difficult, letting us focus on and save only changes that are human reviewers make rather than whole files.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mergic diff groups.json edited.json > diff.json</code></pre>

<p>Now <code>diff.json</code> only has the entries that represent changes from the original <code>groups.json</code>.</p>
<p>The edited version can be reconstructed from the original and the diff with <code>mergic apply</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mergic apply groups.json diff.json > rebuilt.json</code></pre>

<p>The order of <code>rebuilt.json</code> may not be identical to the original <code>edited.json</code>, but the diff will be empty, meaning the file is equivalent:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mergic diff edited.json rebuilt.json
## {}</code></pre>

<p>Finally, to generate a CSV merge table that you'll be able to use with any other tool:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mergic table edited.json > merge.csv</code></pre>

<p>Now the file <code>merge.csv</code> has two columns, <code>original</code> and <code>mergic</code>, where <code>original</code> contains all the values that appeared in the original data and <code>mergic</code> contains the deduplicated keys. You can join this on to your original data and go to town.</p>
<p>Here's how we might do that to quickly get a list of who played the most in these 2013 tennis events:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ join -t, &lt;(sort names.txt) &lt;(sort merge.csv) | cut -d, -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
##  24 Novak Djokovic
##  22 Rafael Nadal
##  21 Serena Williams
##  21 David Ferrer
##  20 Na Li
##  19 Victoria Azarenka
##  19 Agnieszka Radwanska
##  18 Stanislas Wawrinka
##  17 Tommy Robredo
##  17 Sloane Stephens</code></pre>

<p>Note that this is not the same as the result we got before resolving these name issues:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sort names.txt | uniq -c | sort -nr | head
##  21 Rafael Nadal
##  17 Stanislas Wawrinka
##  17 Novak Djokovic
##  17 David Ferrer
##  15 Roger Federer
##  14 Tommy Robredo
##  13 Richard Gasquet
##  11 Victoria Azarenka
##  11 Tomas Berdych
##  11 Serena Williams</code></pre>

<p>As it happens, using a cutoff of 0 and doing no hand editing will still give the correct top ten. In general the desired result and desired level of certainty in its correctness will inform the level of effort that is justified.</p>

<p>Original idea:</p>
<p>"Making merge tables - some entity resolution, python's <code>dedupe</code>, etc."</p>
<p>Expanded idea:</p>
<p>"Hmm... My main idea is to talk about techniques around duplicate detection and joins; I don't know if it's technical enough or R-specific enough. A rough synopsis might be something like: Merging data can be a disaster if you don't do it right. There are assumptions to verify before and after a merge. If the assumptions don't hold, there are steps you can take to ameliorate the problem. Constructing a merge table reduces to the problem of de-duplication. And there's Bilenko's work on learnable string distances etc.! http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ml/papers/marlin-kdd-03.pdf" Obviously that is not a description that is ready to ship, but that's what I'm thinking about. What do you think? Could that become a talk?"</p>
<p>Jared's feedback:</p>
<p>"I actually really like that talk.  It's about data, not stats or programming."</p>

<p>Title:
Practical Mergic: How to Join Anything</p>
<p>Abstract:
Combining data sets can be a huge pain, with possible problems both obvious and insidious. Aaron will present practical approaches for detecting and avoiding potential pitfalls, as well as rigorous and repeatable processes for generating merge tables through reduction to de-duplication. The focus will be on techniques for quickly achieving high accuracy for data sets of moderate size, with brief excursions into the entity resolution literature, machine learning for distance metrics, and applying clustering and visualization techniques including multidimensional scaling.</p>

<hr />
<p>Thoughts from working earlier:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Levenshtein distance is nice, but it turned out I could quickly get a
   "distance" with near-perfect behavior just on zero/nonzero grouping
   by writing a custom one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This amounted to writing a function to extract a "key" which in
      the case of the tennis players was their first initial and a
      regex-determined "last name". Knowing this would work depended on
      looking at the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a more usual distance metric, it would be nice to see a
      distribution of pairwise distances, which might suggest whether
      there are natural breakpoints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was easy to find one type of error by looking at groups that
   became too big.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was nice to look at these as their groups rather than in some
      columnar format - the final output of a merge table is useful but
      not very readable.</p>
</li>
<li>To fix the issue I had to go back to the original site of the data
      and then find extra information from another source. Is there a
      way to make at least the first part easier?</li>
<li>
<p>It would probably be good to see a distribution of group sizes -
      "100 pairs, 20 singletons, 1 group of fifteen" etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's hard to know if I missed errors in the smaller groups and
   singletons who didn't get matched.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I use tSNE (or similar) to get a visualization based just on a
   distance matrix?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>For posterity: look how short this is!</p>

<p>Previous version of docs, focused on the tennis example:</p>
<p>The distance calculation, cutoff evaluation, and partition creation are
currently all in <code>mergic make</code>:</p>
<p>.. code:: bash</p>
<pre><code># see all the possible partitions by their statistics
mergic make names_all.txt

# make a partition using a cutoff of 0.303
mergic make 0.303 &gt; partition.json
</code></pre>
<p>Edit the partition until it's good. Save it as
<code>partition_edited.json</code>.</p>
<p>You can check that your partition is valid and see a cute summary:</p>
<p>.. code:: bash</p>
<pre><code>mergic check partition_edited.json
# 669 items in 354 groups
</code></pre>
<p>You could proceed directly, but there are also diffing tools! Generate a
diff:</p>
<p>.. code:: bash</p>
<pre><code>mergic diff partition.json partition_edited.json &gt; partition_diff.json
</code></pre>
<p>You can apply a diff to reconstruct an edited version:</p>
<p>.. code:: bash</p>
<pre><code>mergic apply partition.json partition_diff.json &gt; partition_rebuilt.json
</code></pre>
<p>Now if you <code>mergic diff</code> the files <code>partition_edited.json</code> and
<code>partition_rebuilt.json</code> the result should just be <code>{}</code> (no
difference).</p>
<p>To generate a CSV merge table that you'll be able to use with any other
tool:</p>
<p>.. code:: bash</p>
<pre><code>mergic table partition_edited.json &gt; partition.csv
</code></pre>
<p>Now the file <code>partition.csv</code> has two columns, <code>original</code> and
<code>mergic</code>, where <code>original</code> contains all the values that appeared in
the original data and <code>mergic</code> contains the deduplicated keys. You can
join this on to your original data and go to town.</p>    <script src="/scripts/konami.js"></script>
