<p>You can do a lot in Python using this editor. Aaron will demonstrate
his setup as well as some fun features.</p>

<p>If data is fallible, can anything be known? Moreover, how are we going to get a reasonable result from this new dump and still have time for lunch? What is the difference between "cleaning" and "analysis"? Will epistemological theorizing improve our quotidian experiences working with data, or is it all just sesquipedalian nonsense? Does skeptical coding bring us closer to the truth?</p>

<p>There's a lot of value in data out there - but there's a lot of nonsense too. Knowing is half the battle!
In this talk, Aaron Schumacher will show you how to use R to interrogate your data and whip it into shape so that you can get good results. We'll iteratively load, explore, merge, graph, and use assertive code to keep our data honest.
In preparation for the talk, please be sure you have installed R: http://watson.nci.nih.gov/cran_mirror/ and RStudio: http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop If you've never used R, you could warm up with a free web tutorial on the basics: http://tryr.codeschool.com/
We'll get you up and running with everything else you need once you arrive!

<p>A Rapid Prototype with D3
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-D3-JS/">NYC D3.js meetup</a>
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-D3-JS/events/121578202/">2013 May 30 Thursday</a></p>
<p>Description: When you only have a few hours, you don't have to cut corners - you can use corners that other people have already made! I'll show simplifying techniques and libraries that were combined to quickly produce a semi-functional prototype at a recent hackathon-style event. Also: some discussion of d3.behavior.zoom().
Bio: Aaron Schumacher is a data guy, educator, and chief robot wrangler for @NYCattends. Sometimes he makes things in D3 for fun. Talk to him about interesting projects.</p>
<p>NYC School Data Explorer Lightning Demo
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-D3-JS/">NYC D3.js meetup</a>
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-D3-JS/events/87414332/">2012 October 22 Monday</a></p>
<p>Demo Description: This quick visualization allows exploration of eight data points over five years for nearly 1,700 NYC public schools. It also features plenty of room for improvement and discussion about what d3 makes easier or more difficult as compared with other visualization tools.
