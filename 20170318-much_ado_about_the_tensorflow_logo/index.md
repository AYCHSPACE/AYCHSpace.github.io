# Much Ado about the TensorFlow Logo

In the beginning, there was [Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) by Douglas Hofstadter.

This "metaphorical fugue on minds and machines in the spirit of Lewis Carroll" includes the [strange loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop) idea and related discussion of consciousness and formal systems. Hofstadter's influence can be seen, for example, [in the name](https://cs.illinois.edu/news/strange-loop-conference) of the [Strange Loop](http://www.thestrangeloop.com/) tech conference.

It seems likely that many people working in artificial intelligence and machine learning have encountered Gödel, Escher, Bach.

Of course, there's also [Chernin Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernin_Entertainment), the production company.

So we shouldn't rule out the possibility that Google engineers are fans of [Chernin's work](http://www.imdb.com/company/co0286257/). I hear [Hidden Figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures) is quite good. And I guess a lot of people like [New Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Girl)?

In any event, somehow we get to this TensorFlow logo:

If you look carefully, does it seem like the right side of the "T" view is too short?

This very serious concern appears as [issue #1922](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1922) on the TensorFlow github, and [on the TensorFlow mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!topic/discuss/XhO1sqp4l4g) complete with ASCII art illustration.

The consensus response seemed to be some variant of "won't fix" (it wouldn't look as cool, anyway) until...

![TensorFlow logo - new?](img/tf-new.jpg)

As of around the 1.0 release of TensorFlow, which was around the first [TensorFlow Dev Summit](https://events.withgoogle.com/tensorflow-dev-summit/), this logo variant seems to be in vogue. It removes the (possibly contentious) shadows, and adds a picture of a computation graph, in case you were about to forget that TensorFlow is about computation graphs. (If you want to think of it as a neural network, you're free to do so.)

Logos are fun!

Thanks to [David Cook](https://twitter.com/divergentdave) and [Philip Ashlock](https://twitter.com/philipashlock) for helping me find Chernin again based on a very murky memory.

I'm working on [Building TensorFlow systems from components](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/57823), a workshop at [OSCON 2017](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx).
