# Your Favorite Class

I read a fairly bad [book][] which included this:

[book]: /20160207-talk_like_ted/

> When you think back to your favorite college class, there's a good
> chance the professor you most enjoyed injected a fair amount of
> humor into his or her presentations.

That section was about humor in presentations, but the reference got
me thinking about my own favorite college class, which wasn't
particularly funny.

I couldn't name or even recognize the professor of the class I
remember most strongly. The class was memorable because the professor
wasn't doing the same things other professors did. The professor was
orchestrating the class so that _students_ did things.

This was the first class I recall in which the professor would pose a
question and tell us to turn and talk about it with the people near us
for a solid five minutes, multiple times through a "lecture."

This class had a long reading list from which we chose what we wanted
to read. I read [The Agile Gene][]. I probably thought more about that
book than anything else I read as an undergrad.

In this class we did a group project. My group decided to transcribe
[Family Guy][] in the [International Phonetic Alphabet][]. It was so
much fun, I'm sure we learned more about the IPA and thought more
about regional dialects than we would have done with a more typical
assignment.

I learned more about teaching techniques like these, which I might
summarize as [student-centered][], when I studied
[teaching at Bard][]. They were so rare at [my university][] that it
was shocking when I encountered a class that didn't reduce perfectly
well to a series of videos.

If the most memorable thing about a class is the person teaching it,
that's an indictment of the class, not a recommendation. It certainly
doesn't hurt for a teacher to be charismatic, but it's sad for
students to go through school hoping to encounter super-teachers who
are expert entertainers, as if that's the best or only way to learn.
