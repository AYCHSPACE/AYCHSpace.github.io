# Wrap-up from DC Hack and Tell #4

<div>
<p>I've been putting together these wrap-ups from&#160;<a href="http://hackandtell.org/">Hack and Tell</a>&#160;in DC for a while now. They go out to the&#160;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/">meetup</a>&#160;list and they're archived&#160;<a href="https://github.com/hackandtell/wrapup">on github</a>, but I like them so much I thought I'd put them here too. Working through the back-catalog:<br>

Time to wrap up the Christmas Invasion and put a&#160;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/medialibrary/s0/images/episode-promo/s0_01.jpg">bow</a>&#160;on it... Here are all the good things we saw, in non-random order!<br>
<ul class="task-list">
<br>
	<li>Aaron talked about lots of&#160;<a href="http://planspace.org/nyc-tests/">graphs</a>&#160;made from NYC test scores.</li>
<br>
	<li>Rick showed a really neat Medicare visualization that he made, which started as a&#160;<a href="http://hackforchange.org/">National Day of Civic Hacking</a>&#160;project. (<a href="http://www.geekosystem.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bowties3.gif">Cool</a>!)</li>
<br>
	<li>
<a href="http://juliangindi.com/">Julian</a>&#160;demoed the next big programming language, MyCoolLang aka&#160;<a href="http://lebowski.juliangindi.com/">Lebowski</a>, rich with Python and LLVM goodness.</li>
<br>
	<li>Chris fought the good fight against lighswitches, automating his home via his&#160;<a href="http://www.meethue.com/">lightbulb</a>s' port 80 (duh).</li>
<br>
	<li>In addition to inventing languages, Julian also improves existing ones - he showed how he became a Python core dev and improved performance (timing).</li>
<br>
	<li>"So your friendly neighborhood bikeshare station is out of bikes again. What are the odds?"&#160;<a href="http://cmgiven.github.io/bikeshare-odds/">CHRIS WILL SHOW YOU THE ODDS.</a>
</li>
<br>
	<li>And Joseph showed some of the magic of&#160;<a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt">salt</a>,&#160;<a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">vagrant</a>, and of course&#160;<a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salty-vagrant">salty vagrant</a>.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<br>
Happy solstice, everybody! See you on&#160;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/events/155299672/">January 13, 2014</a>!<br>
