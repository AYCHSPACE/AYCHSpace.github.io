# Functional Javascript is

[Functional Javascript](http://funjs.herokuapp.com/) is impressively good. Though Javascript throughout, it helped me to start using [decorators](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/) in Python more effectively. There are a lot of good ideas in there.

The author, [Michael Fogus](https://twitter.com/fogus), is also an author of [The Joy of Clojure](http://www.joyofclojure.com/), which greatly simplified my search for a [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) book to read. I also saw that he lives in the DC area, which made me hope to see him speaking at local events.
