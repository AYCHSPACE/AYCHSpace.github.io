 * planspace.org has these slides

Hi! I'm Aaron. All these slides, and a corresponding write-up (you're reading it) are on my blog (which you're on).

![Deep Learning Analytics](img/dla.png)

-----

I work at [Deep Learning Analytics](http://www.deeplearninganalytics.com/) (DLA). We do deep learning work for government and commercial customers. DLA is a great place to work, and one of the ways it's great is that it sends us to conferences and such things.


------

![Deep RL Bootcamp](img/deep_rl_bootcamp.png)

------

DLA sent me to the first UC Berkeley [Deep RL Bootcamp](https://www.deepbootcamp.io/) organized by Abbeel, Duan, Chen, and Karpathy. It was a great experience and it largely inspired this talk.

I have a separate [summary write-up](/20170830-berkeley_deep_rl_bootcamp/) about my experience at the bootcamp, and they've since put up all the [videos, slides, and labs](https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/lectures), so you can see everything that was covered there.


-----

![Sutton and Barto's textbook](img/sutton_and_barto.jpg)

-----

The other major source for this talk is Sutton and Barto's textbook, which I like a lot.

The picture shows [the first edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning), which is not what you want. The second edition is [available free online](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/the-book-2nd.html), and was last updated about a week ago (November 5, 2017).

Sutton and Barto are major figures in reinforcement learning, and they do not follow any [no original research rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research), making their book really fairly exciting, if you're not put off by the length (over 400 pages).

(The diagrams on the cover are not neural nets, but backup diagrams.)

![multi-armed bandit](img/bandit.jpg)

-----

multi-armed bandit

one state, one set of actions, stochastic reward

which ad to show, etc.

(also phrase as supervised learning?)


-----

exploration vs. exploitation

\epsilon-greedy policy

-----

usually do what looks best

\epsilon of the time, choose random action

bandit is one-state; even more need to explore in bigger MDPs

connect to active learning

two reasons for \epsilon-greedy:

 * explore all (find optimal)
 * for off-policy (what did I mean, here?)


-----

Monte Carlo returns

-----

v(s) = ?

keep track and average


run to end

many times

average

sample it! (rollouts again; note doing with model vs. with experience)


-----

non-stationarity

-----

v(s) changes over time


-----

stochastic gradient... moving average

-----

new mean = old mean + \alpha(new sample - old mean)

exponential mean

relate to SGD

\alpha, \beta vs. \eta


-----

![MDP diagram](img/mdp_diagram.png)

-----

Example:

s_1 to s_2 deterministically

Question: How is v(s) related to v(s')?

note another popular way to represent MDPs

v(s) = r' + v(s')

"Our approach is most directly applicable to Zero-sum games of perfect information."

alphago zero can only play legal moves, but stupid moves aren't
forbidden, so it is less constrained than alphago original~

conclusion?

"Ironically, the major advances in RL over the past few years all boil down to making RL look less like RL and more like supervised learning."

Thank you!

Thank you for coming!

Thanks again to [DLA](https://www.deeplearninganalytics.com/) for supporting me in learning more about reinforcement learning, and in being the audience for the earliest version of this talk, providing lots of valuable feedback.

Thanks to the [DC Deep Learning Working Group](https://www.meetup.com/DC-Deep-Learning-Working-Group/) for working through the second iteration of this talk with me, providing even more good feedback.

Thanks to [Eric Haengel](https://twitter.com/EricHaengel) for help with Go and in thinking about the [AlphaGo Zero paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270.epdf?author_access_token=VJXbVjaSHxFoctQQ4p2k4tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PVW4gB86EEpGqTRDtpIz-2rmo8-KG06gqVobU5NSCFeHILHcVFUeMsbvwS-lxjqQGg98faovwjxeTUgZAUMnRQ).

Here are my top resources for learning more about deep reinforcement
learning (and having a little fun).

The content of [A Brief Survey of Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05866) is similar to this talk. It does a quick intro to a lot of deep reinforcement learning.

Karpathy's [Pong from Pixels](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) is a readable introduction as well, focused on policy gradient, with readable code.

If you can afford the time, I recommend all of Sutton and Barto's [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/the-book-2nd.html). The authors are two major reinforcement learning pioneers, to the extent that they sometimes introduce new concepts in the pages of their textbook.

David Silver's [course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html) is quite good. It largely follows Sutton and Barto's text, and also references Csaba Szepesvรกri's [Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/papers/RLAlgsInMDPs.pdf).

The [Deep Reinforcement Learning Bootcamp](https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/lectures) that inspired this talk has lots of materials online, so you can get the full treatment if you like!

If you want to get into code, [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) and [baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines) could be nice places to get started.

If you want to have fun, you can play Go with humans at the [National Go Center](http://nationalgocenter.org/), and I always recommend the [Hack and Tell](http://dc.hackandtell.org/) meetup for a good time nerding out with people over a range of fun projects.
