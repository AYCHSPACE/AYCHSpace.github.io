*A short talk for [AIR](http://www.air.org/).*

The title of my talk is *Please stop saying “Big Data”*. I'd like to cut “Big Data” down to size for you.

[Alan Kay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTAghAJcO1o) earlier this year which included this:

> Big data is a way that a lot of people are trying to make money today. And it's a favorite of marketing people, because it's in the wind. Everybody has heard the phrase “big data.” Not everybody knows what it means. And so it's the perfect context for doing things that people can say, “Well this is an application of big data and this is an application of big data.” But in fact, the interesting future's not about data at all - it's about meaning.
