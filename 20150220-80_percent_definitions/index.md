# 80% Definitions

The [Pareto Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) describes 80% of effects coming from 20% of causes. If you're lucky, you might get 80% effectiveness for 20% effort.

Of course, 80% of Pareto examples are made up.

 * big data
 * the cloud
 * data science

I think we're mostly through the hype cycle for these, at least in some circles, but these phrases are still sometimes poorly understood.

I'm going to give “80% definitions” for these terms. They are deliberately reductive, but they give a very high ratio of useful content to marketing spin.

big data

more than one hard drive

-----

If you have big data, you know about it, because you can't fit it on one hard drive. That's it.

You might have unstructured data, which is hard to work with. You might have data on different computers because many people have small data sets, which is hard to work with. You might have an unfamiliar data source, which is hard to work with.

But if you can fit your data on one hard drive, it isn't big. Bigness is about size.

In this case, I think it's much clearer the kind of problem this company is solving. Somebody was trying to do integrated business planning but they couldn't because they could only handle one hard drive of data at a time. It's hard to work with more data than that.

But if that isn't your problem, don't waste your time.

the cloud

-----


-----

computers you can't see

-----

“The cloud” is computers you can't see. Like the internet? Yes. Exactly like the internet.

It's nice to be able to use computers you can't see and have them do clever things, but fundamentally it's just computers.

Here the substitution is really helpful in having intelligent thoughts about this claim. What power do you have, mystery man? It could be the power to easily use more computers whenever he wants to. But also, often somebody owns the cloud computers and somebody else uses them; which side are you on, mystery man? Do you have power because you're selling cloud computing, or using it?

data science

-----


-----

counting

-----

I'm being particularly hard on data science. On the one hand, some techniques are obviously more sophisticated. But on the other hand, some techniques (like the apriori algorithm) are *literally* just clever ways of counting.

There's something to be said for counting. If you're not counting, you don't know how many you have. You should count! And also, you may be counting wrong. It's not always easy to count properly!

I find that with the text inserted here it's much easier for me to notice that the speaker is holding some sort of weird pipe in front of his face.
