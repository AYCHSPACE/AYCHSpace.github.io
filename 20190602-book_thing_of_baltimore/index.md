# The Book Thing of Baltimore

I really like [The Book Thing of Baltimore](https://bookthing.org/). It's like a [Little Free Library](https://littlefreelibrary.org/) but [with 200,000 books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_Thing). It's as great [as everyone says](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-book-thing-baltimore-maryland) and I think there should be more of them.

Thoughts at the thing:

 * Books can seem so major, so heavy, so important... but most of them
   are ephemeral.
 * Nearly all book-reading is for entertainment.
 * Many things that we own, we don't really need to own.
 * Operations don't need to be complicated: The book thing doesn't
   track each book, doesn't cycle them or worry about staleness; you
   don't have to sign up to volunteer, you just show up. Their
   "processes" are dead simple, and it works.
