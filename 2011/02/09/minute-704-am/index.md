<p>Minute 7:04 AM</p>
<p>Sometimes Aaron wakes up with the wrong idea about where he is. It's<br>remarkably disorienting, for example, to think you are waking up in<br>Menasha, Wisconsin, in the United States of America, under a yellow<br>blanket with butterflies that you could imagine your grandmother<br>embroidered on herself.</p>
<p>This blanket is just green and oddly textured, left behind by Aaron's<br>college friend Dan when he headed back to the US. The texture, and the<br>Korean crooning from the radio now, are enough to prevent mistakes of<br>location without any conscious effort.</p>
<p>Fa la la, Aaron's brain is busy with something still. Terribly busy,<br>and terribly quiet about whatever it might be that it's up to, like a<br>child working alone on some misconceived project alone in his room.<br>Just a few more minutes, don't interrupt. Maybe I'll really finish it<br>this time and everything will be all better.</p>
