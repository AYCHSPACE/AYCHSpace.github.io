# I discovered a poem (a poem)

<p>I discovered a poem
<br>of such great beauty
<br>I was moved to tears
<br>and overwrought for days
<br>
<br>I am convinced that this poem
<br>comes directly from God's anthology
<br>so perfect is its every line
<br>it could be no other way
<br>
<br>Having found such a poem
<br>is a kind of heavy burden
<br>having carved it from the rock
<br>perhaps they'll name it after me</p>
