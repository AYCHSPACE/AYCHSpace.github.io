# Aladdin translated by Yasmine Seale

The history of the story of Aladdin, given in some detail in the
introduction, is interesting. In the story itself, I was hoping for
something really different from Disney's Aladdin, and I was somewhat
disappointed there. There are differences, but they're not so huge.

The front flap of the cover promises "a newfound appreciation for the
ingenuity of the heroine, Princess Badr al-Budur, who outwits an evil
magician to ultimately save Aladdin's life." I was looking forward to
that, but Aladdin makes the plan to have the princess poison the
magician. The princess does successfully poison the magician's drink
(exactly as Aladdin directed her) but I was hoping for a little more
agency for the princess.

The translator and editor point out that the story has a feel
consistent with being told by someone telling stories for their life,
and I think that's true: pushing the action foward, and-then'ing the
next chapter and the next, with no time to go back and edit. It's
probably a good thing that most stories aren't produced that way.
