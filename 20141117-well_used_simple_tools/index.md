# Well-Used Simple Tools

*A [short talk](http://www.meetup.com/Design-Thinking-DC/events/216029412/) for [Design Thinking DC](http://www.meetup.com/Design-Thinking-DC/).*

This is an image from the drafting process for this talk. Paper is my favorite invention. [1] You could read these books on paper if you would like.

My thoughts on email and to-do management come directly from this [Bit Literacy](http://bitliteracy.com/), which you can get for free at [bitliteracy.com](http://bitliteracy.com/).

My thoughts about text and separation of concerns, among other things, were certainly influenced by [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer).

[ReWork](http://37signals.com/rework/), which is largely the same as the freely available [Getting Real](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/), brings ideas of working effectively to working at work.
