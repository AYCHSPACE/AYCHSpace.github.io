<p>Minute 7:02 AM</p>
<p>What happened yesterday? Had he been out drinking? Was that just a<br>dream? Aaron's insides are like an unfinished watercolor. Not alcohol,<br>then, but not quite done setting, for some reason. Had he actually met<br>those two... No, that was definitely a dream. Better not get up for a<br>minute.</p>
<p>The song finishes and now it's the calm morning guy voice. Korean<br>Korean Korean, he says. Korean Korean-name possessive's song<br>object-marker listen-respecting-the-listener past-tense formal. Thanks<br>for the info, morning guy.</p>
<p>Pulling all the world's energy into himself, Aaron summons the magic<br>of motion to pick himself up and hurl himself onto his stomach. Now he<br>is a beached whale, only protected from the unkind sun that drops down<br>from a frosted window at the foot of the bed by a seaweed blanket. He<br>releases the energy of the world and it exhales to flat again.</p>
