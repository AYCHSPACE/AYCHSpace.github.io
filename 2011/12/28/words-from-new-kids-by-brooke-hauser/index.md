# Words from The New Kids by Brooke Hauser

<span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Kids-Dreams-Journeys-Immigrant/dp/1439163286">The new kids</a>: Big dreams and brave journeys at a high school for immigrant teens<br>Brooke Hauser<br><br>I read this book about the International School @ Prospect Heights (17K524) for my work reading group book club thing. It's a book of stories. I haven't read any fiction in a while. I guess I read some Douglas Adams over the summer. Maybe what I mean is, I haven't read any mundane fiction in a while. Not that the stories of the students and teachers are mundane - they follow the ordinary rules of physics is all. They're good stories. They give you a human view of a lot incredible lives. But it isn't a book of ideas, unless the idea is "let's have empathy" - and that isn't a bad idea.<br><br>It did have some interesting words!<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umber">umber</a><br>sable ponytail: seems to be just an ordinary ponytail<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo">vitiligo</a>: I had wondered about this and am glad to have a word for it now.<br>brackish (okay I do know what this means...)<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelier">atelier</a><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrim_(material)">scrim</a><br><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=C3rXQwx1frAC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=tibetan+spicoli&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mzQ5MrWiWp&amp;sig=i94GVj3W-uvQNgEedYuk7htaB-k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jH_7TtCGH6n10gGLiIWXDQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tibetan%20spicoli&amp;f=false">Tibetan Spicoli</a>: this one is interesting... it seems like the only place this phrase has ever been used is in this book. Is it a typo? Is it just overwhelmed by other uses? Seriously the only other reference I can find is some joker garbage on urban dictionary...<br><a href="https://www.google.com/search?gcx=w&amp;q=kitten+heels&amp;safe=active&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=loD7TuOrIYby0gGj6I3AAg&amp;biw=1093&amp;bih=706&amp;sei=m4D7TtqzPKfo0QGItYjFAg">kitten heels</a><br>Les Brown: comical motivational speaker?<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality">liminal </a>space between<br>ebullient: cheerful and happy; I knew that...<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skein">skein </a>(noodle): like a ball (skein) of yarn...<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_Paris">arrondissement</a>: district of Paris<br>stupefaction (I guess I know this one too)<br>chafing-dish: those things they use to keep food hot at buffets<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batusi">Batusi</a>: THIS IS REALLY FUNNY<br>compas (re: bachata)<br><a href="http://www.papermart.com/Product%20Pages/Product.aspx?GroupID=19005&amp;ParentGroupID=19006">tulle </a>(re: taffeta)<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chignon_(hairstyle)">chignon</a><br><a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?skuId=2057945&amp;productId=xlsImpprod2960039&amp;navAction=push&amp;navCount=1&amp;categoryId=cat80187">T-zone</a> (cosmetics): apparently your forehead down to your nose makes a "T"?</span>
