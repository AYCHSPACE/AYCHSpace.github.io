<h1>Tall Infographic: NYC Public School Grade Configurations</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday October 13, 2013</p>
<p>It's not uncommon to try to categorize schools as elementary, middle, and high schools. This is a considerable simplification. Here's a visualization of the grades each of the 1,818 NYC public schools are designed to serve:</p>
<p><a href="schoolconfigs.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-435 aligncenter" alt="school grade configurations visualization" src="schoolconfigs.png"></a></p>
<p>It takes two schools to make one vertical pixel here. (There are 23 PK-6 schools, if that helps with scale.)&#160;There are 51 unique configurations. There's a lot going on.</p>
<p>Note in particular the diversity of schools serving very young students - the so-called "early childhood" schools - at the top. Also note that NYC has three schools that will eventually serve students in grades 9-14, at the bottom there. The divide between schools that do and don't offer pre-kindergarten programs is interesting as well. (Public pre-kindergarten is also offered by some non-school entities in NYC, not shown here.)</p>
<p>I think it makes more sense to do academic analysis at the grade level rather than the school level. Going directly to the student level would be better still.</p>
<p>The image is based on data from the 2013-10-13 NYC <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/EnterpriseOperations/DIIT/OOD/default.htm">LCGMS</a> file, looking at the "Grades Final" column, which should represent all the grades each school is designed to serve. (The "Grades" column represents grades actually served this year, and shows considerably <em>more</em> variety, since schools are "phasing in" and "phasing out" in New York.) Made with R.</p>
