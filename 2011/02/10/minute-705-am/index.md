# Minute 7:05 AM

<p>Minute 7:05 AM</p>
<p>There is no past, no present, no future. Is that success?</p>
<p>Then, the sound is first. A dull thud, as if the sound is still<br>lethargic too. Chemicals along axons and dendrites carefully relay a<br>message, and Aaron works out what made the sound. The wall hit his<br>elbow. Groan.</p>
<p>The bed is flush against the wall, and flush again against the wall<br>under the window at the foot of the bed. The head of the bed is flush<br>against the short side of a bookshelf. The mattress is smaller than a<br>standard twin, in every dimension. It is not a royal flush.</p>
<p>If Aaron flung out his arm in the other direction, it would touch the<br>desk across two feet of floor space, or the chair that rolls in that<br>space. A foot kicked in that direction could contact the mini-fridge<br>door. Not that anything's inside. A higher kick would hit the<br>mini-cabinet over the fridge. A kick straight up would part clothes<br>hanging from a hanger bar that spans the room, maybe six feet long.<br>Here is a vampire spaceship submarine palace.</p>
<p>Aaron hopes the sound from the elbow wall doesn't disturb his<br>neighbor, just a hand's breadth away.</p>
