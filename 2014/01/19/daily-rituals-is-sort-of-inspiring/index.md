# Daily Rituals is sort of inspiring



<blockquote>Be regular and orderly in your life so that you may be violent and original in your work.</blockquote>

<a href="0307273601"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-785" alt="daily rituals cover" src="0307273601"></a>Somehow I saw that <a href="http://www.samharris.org/free-will">Sam Harris</a> was <a href="http://www.samharris.org/book_store/book/daily-rituals-how-artists-work">recommending</a> this book. It looked interesting, so I bought and read it, though much of the material can be read on the <a href="http://dailyroutines.typepad.com/">blog</a> it started as. It seems to have enjoyed some success now, getting <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/08/daily-rituals-mason-currey-review">press coverage</a> here and there.

There are a lot of idiosyncrasies described, but the most common thread seems to be one that is rather at odds with the bite-sized micro-sectioning of the book: many many productive people are productive by focusing on work for stretches of three or more hours at a time, as close to undisturbed and undistracted as possible. Nobody seems to write novels while reading buzzfeed lists and watching videos on youtube.

Another interesting tendency is that a lot of people consume a lot of caffeine, and a fairly large number even use amphetamines (it isn't just&#160;Erd&#337;s). I'm not sure I'll start going in for the harder stuff, but it makes me feel better about drinking Red Bull every now and then.
