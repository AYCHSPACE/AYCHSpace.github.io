# Official GeekyBack and "SSH in a Box" Lyrics



You may be familiar with Justin Timberlake's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOHvDP_vCs">SexyBack</a>...

GeekyBack

I'm bringing geeky back.

Those other newbs don't know how to hack

If you're so 1337, why'd you buy a Mac?

Sudo apt-get and I'll complete your stack.

load 'em to the cache...

[Bridge]

Dirty data

You see I've tackled

unicode in waves.

I'd keep you open if you'd only save.

It's just that no one hexed in ASA.

Get your hexy on

Go ahead be coding

[Repeat 6 times]

Get your hexy on

I'm bringing geeky back

Them other ... don't know how to hack

Come let me pyparse all up in your stack.

'Cause your regex sucks I gotta fix it fast.

load 'em to the cache...

[Bridge]

I'm bringing hexy back

You subpar hackers watch my grep attack.

If that's your URL you best urlparse a path

'Cause your punctuation is all outta whack.

Take 'em to the meetup

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Come here URL

Go ahead be coding

come for the hack

Go ahead be coding

S-E-D

Go ahead be coding

Scripts in C?

SSH in a Box

Not gonna mail you a cleartext string

Cause creds like that don't hide anything.

Not gonna force another RSA start

Girl you're gotta learn more than wi-re-shark.

Not gonna default you to homelessville

Cause a password like that is the kind they steal.

Wanna MD5 you to a UPC code

Somethin' unique, girl.

It's ssh in a box

ssh in a box, babe

It's ssh in a box

Ooh, ssh in a box, girl

I'm secure enough to know

You need encryption, and I got just the key,

A two factor key--that's right--a second plus one.

To all the admins out there with users to protect

It's easy to do just follow these steps...

Step 1, apt-get on that box

Step 2, open ports on that box

Step 3, ssh to that box

And that's the way you do it

It's ssh in a box!
