# Alan Kay on Big Data

During his recent [Papers We Love](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love) DC [presentation](http://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-DC/events/212419432/), [David Nolen](https://twitter.com/swannodette) recommended this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTAghAJcO1o) by [Alan Kay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay), which opens with his thoughts on "big data":

> Big data is a way that a lot of people are trying to make money today. And it's a favorite of marketing people, because it's in the wind. Everybody has heard the phrase "big data." Not everybody knows what it means. And so it's the perfect context for doing things that people can say, "Well this is an application of big data and this is an application of big data." But in fact, the interesting future's not about data at all - it's about meaning.
