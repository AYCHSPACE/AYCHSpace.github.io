<h1>Translating The Social Network</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday November 21, 2010</p>
<p>I finally got to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network">The Social Network</a>, which was released 2010 October 1 in the US but not until 2010 November 18 here in Korea. &#160;I don't know why there was such a lag. &#160;It's tempting to guess it's for subtitling or something like that, but some other movies have been released on the same day in the US and Korea. &#160;Anyway, let's take a look at the American and Korean posters.</p>
<p><a href="socialnetworkK.jpg"><img src="socialnetworkK.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The American poster says "You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies." &#160;The Korean poster says "5&#50613;&#47749;&#51032; &#50728;&#46972;&#51064; &#52828;&#44396; / &#51204;&#49464;&#44228; &#52572;&#50672;&#49548; &#50613;&#47564;&#51109;&#51088; / &#54616;&#48260;&#46300; &#52380;&#51116;&#44032; &#52285;&#51312;&#54620; &#49548;&#49500; &#45348;&#53944;&#50892;&#53356; &#54785;&#47749;!"</p>
<p><a href="socialnetworkE.jpg"><img border="0" src="socialnetworkE.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Interestingly, the Korean poster is nothing like a translation of the American poster. It says, roughly "500 million online friends / The youngest billionaire in the world / The social network revolution that was started by a Harvard genius!"</p>
<p>Especially as I'm working on some subtitling right now, it is interesting to me how different these are. &#160;The American poster focuses on the personal drama that the movie actually tries to deliver, and that American audiences presumably want to see. &#160;The Korean poster emphasizes the financial success and prestigious college association of the lead - explicitly accessing Korea's twin obsessions. &#160;It may also be attempting to provide more background information for a Korean audience that is less familiar with facebook. &#160;But it also totally removes mention of interpersonal conflict, which Korea certainly has but doesn't like to talk about so much in public.</p>
<p>Of course these are just the posters. &#160;Watching the movie I noticed mostly that the subtitles really summarize a lot. &#160;It's like reading an abstract of the film. &#160;It may be particularly the case for The Social Network because a lot of the characters talk really fast, but there was a lot of simplifying between the original script and the subtitles that Korean audiences were reading. &#160;Something I may take into consideration as I write some subtitles.</p>
<p>The movie itself was fun. &#160;I really enjoyed all the references to computer stuff that I used to be into. &#160;It was cool to know what they were talking about with all the "Linux Apache Perl MySQL emacs root" stuff. &#160;I've installed/used/had all those things! &#160;The early scene where Zuckerberg is "hacking" for pictures was pretty fun. &#160;Made hacking/blogging seem pretty neat. &#160;Even though the "hacking" was really just finding quick ways to download photos that were already publicly accessible on the web.</p>
<p>I didn't know that Napster guy had any involvement in Facebook - or that he was played by Justin Timberlake. Huh.</p>
<p>The movie also kind of made me feel like I should quit doing a normal job and take over the world somehow. &#160;Yeah! &#160;Innovation! &#160;Breaking the mold! Yeah!</p>
