# 1,236 multiple-choice MCAS math items

<div>
<p>The items are all available on <a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/MCAS_math_mult">github</a>; this post duplicates the repo's README:<br>
<br>
A friend and I went through all the&#160;<a href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/mcas/">MCAS</a>&#160;math exam PDFs available as of January 2013 and used the Mac screenshot function to create PNG images for every multiple-choice question that didn't explicitly require some additional resource, like a ruler. We recorded the correct answers in simple text files. This produced 1,236 items from 53 exams offered from 2007 to 2012 for grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10.<br>
<br>
I plan to use these items in a project I'm working on, but I'd like to make them available in this format for others as well, so that the work we did is not needlessly duplicated. Thanks to the sensibleness of the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, re-use is allowed. Their complete copyright message is copied at the bottom of this README.<br>
<br>
Each exam administration has its own folder. The folders are named like&#160;<code>s2008g10math</code>.<br>
</p>
<ul>
<br>
	<li>The first character indicates when the exam is from. The spring administration (<code>s</code>) is when almost all exams are offered. There are also March (<code>m</code>) and November (<code>n</code>) re-tests for tenth grade.</li>
<br>
	<li>The next four characters indicate the year of the exam.</li>
<br>
	<li>The&#160;<code>g</code>&#160;is a handy delimiter meaning "grade" and the digits that follow it represent the grade level of the exam.</li>
<br>
	<li>The last four characters are always&#160;<code>math</code>&#160;because that's all we looked at for this.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<br>
Within each exam administration folder are a bunch of PNG files and a&#160;<code>key.txt&#160;</code>text file. The PNG filenames include a date and time that orders them correctly. Be careful - the correct ordering is not always produced by alphabetizing the filenames. The text file&#160;<code>key.txt</code>&#160;includes one answer per line (A, B, C, or D) and sometimes comments starting with a hash. Comments like "#calc" were meant to indicate the start of the exam section that allowed calculators. These are mostly correct, but I gave up caring about the calculator rules, so I'm not that concerned with whether they're right. In my further processing I just completely ignore comments.<br>
<br>
I am not in any way affiliated with Masachusetts or its education system. I just hope that by making these items available I might in some small way contribute to improving education overall. Use these items well!<br>
