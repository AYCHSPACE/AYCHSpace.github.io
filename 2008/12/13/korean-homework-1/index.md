# 한국어 숙제 (Korean Homework) 제1과 (Chapter 1)

<p>In my Korean class we are assigned homework from a workbook, which is then checked every class. Our textbook also has exercises for every chapter, but these are not strictly required, or indeed even mentioned. I am doing these exercises for practice both of the language and of the Korean keyboard layout. I can't imagine an audience that would find these terribly interesting, but on the internet this is no obstacle to publishing.<br><br>1.1<br>1) &#50741;&#45768;&#45796;.<br>2) &#51105;&#45768;&#45796;.<br>3) &#44277;&#48512;&#54633;&#45768;&#45796;.<br>4) &#51077;&#49845;&#45768;&#45796;.<br>5) &#47673;&#49845;&#45768;&#45796;.<br><br>1.2<br>1) &#50433;&#45768;&#44620;? &#45348;, &#50433;&#45768;&#45796;.<br>2) &#48176;&#50881;&#45768;&#44620;? &#45348;, &#48176;&#50881;&#45768;&#45796;.<br>3) &#47560;&#49901;&#45768;&#44620;? &#45348;, &#47560;&#49901;&#45768;&#45796;.<br>4) &#48261;&#49845;&#45768;&#44620;? &#45348;, &#47673;&#49845;&#45768;&#45796;.<br>5) &#51069;&#49845;&#45768;&#44620;? &#45348;, &#51069;&#49845;&#45768;&#45796;.<br><br>1.3<br>1) &#49324;&#49901;&#45768;&#44620;?<br>2) &#44592;&#45796;&#47532;&#49901;&#45768;&#44620;?<br>3) &#51069;&#51004;&#49901;&#45768;&#44620;?<br>4) &#51105;&#49688;&#49901;&#45768;&#44620;?<br>5) &#51452;&#47924;&#49901;&#45768;&#44620;?<br><br>1.4<br>1) &#48372;&#49901;&#45768;&#44620;? &#45348;, &#48389;&#45768;&#45796;.<br>2) &#51069;&#51004;&#49901;&#45768;&#44620;? &#45348;, &#51069;&#49845;&#45768;&#45796;.<br>3) &#50868;&#46041;&#54616;&#49901;&#45768;&#44620;? &#45348;, &#50868;&#46041;&#54633;&#45768;&#45796;.<br>4) &#51105;&#49688;&#49901;&#45768;&#44620;? &#45348;, &#47673;&#49845;&#45768;&#45796;.<br>5) &#51452;&#47924;&#49901;&#45768;&#44620;? &#45348;, &#51105;&#45768;&#45796;.<br><br>1.5<br>1) &#53440;&#49901;&#49884;&#50724;.<br>2) &#44592;&#45796;&#47532;&#49901;&#49884;&#50724;.<br>3) &#51069;&#51004;&#49901;&#49884;&#50724;.<br>4) &#50505;&#51004;&#49901;&#49884;&#50724;.<br>5) &#51105;&#49688;&#49901;&#49884;&#50724;.</p>
