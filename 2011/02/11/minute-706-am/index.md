<p>Minute 7:06 AM</p>
<p>Sounds travel very well here. Last night Aaron knew that, which is<br>part of why his iPhone, standing in the cradle on top of the clock<br>radio, is still set to vibrate. Bought that radio in America. Korea<br>doesn't seem to know about clock radios.</p>
<p>The alarm last night Aaron set to "Timba", which is some sort of<br>drumming sound. Maybe a different alarm sound will be surprising in<br>the morning, thought night Aaron. Maybe morning Aaron will actually<br>get up, thought night Aaron, like an ancient tycoon writing his will,<br>hoping his descendants will honor his wishes, knowing their<br>motivations will not be his own. Night Aaron and morning Aaron have<br>that kind of relationship.</p>
