# Self-Portrait (a poem)

<span><br>The Hatfield Clan 1897<br>family photo<br>men hold firearms<br><br>a feeling of revulsion<br>an animal past so human<br>a king smiling with a sword<br><br><br>shall I then be pictured naked<br>without muscle, sinew, bone<br><br>hang a landscape<br>with a mountain<br>with a forest<br>grain, waves, amber<br><br><br>can we find a phenotype<br>distinct from DNA<br>when we ask the questions backwards<br>for answers inside us<br><br>with the pots and all the kettles<br>cupboards, mantles both are bare<br></span>
