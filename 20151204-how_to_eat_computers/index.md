# How to Eat Computers

*A ten-minute talk for first, second, and third-graders at the [Léman Manhattan Preparatory School](http://www.lemanmanhattan.org/)'s elementary school, which they call their “[Lower School](http://www.lemanmanhattan.org/academics/lower)”, on Friday December 4, 2015. I was invited to speak at Léman because I volunteered to help out at schools for “[Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/)”. ([slides](big.html))*

That's right, it's four!

So now you know binary.

Everything inside the computer is binary.

To get the computer to say “Hello”, it takes quite a lot of binary!
