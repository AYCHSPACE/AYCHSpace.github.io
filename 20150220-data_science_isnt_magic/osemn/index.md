# Data Science is OSEMN

The 2010 [Taxonomy of Data Science](http://www.dataists.com/2010/09/a-taxonomy-of-data-science/) from Hilary Mason and Chris Wiggins describes this description of what a data scientist does. It notably does not include a discussion of identifying problems to solve. (If we start with a Problem, perhaps we have POSEMN?)
