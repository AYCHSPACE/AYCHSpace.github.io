<br>Just from the title, I have to wonder if it had any connection to the Kindle. &#160;A quick search reveals... that you can buy Frindle for the Kindle, but not whether Frindle helped inspire the Kindle name. &#160;Maybe not.<br><br>Anyway this is a kids' book from 1996; I'm a little amazed I'd never heard of it. &#160;The main ideas about dictionaries being descriptive rather than prescriptive, on a fundamental level, and the general nature of language as a social construction, are some cool ideas that I kept encountering through high school and beyond. &#160;I like that this book presents those ideas in a very accessible form.<br><br>I identified with the use of dictionaries in school. &#160;I remember, vaguely, doing vocabulary lists and looking stuff up in paper dictionaries when I was in grade school. &#160;But I have to wonder, do kids do that these days? &#160;Is anybody still really using paper dictionaries? &#160;Even when I was in grade school, all those years ago, the class set of paper dictionaries was getting to be a bit dusty and unappreciated. &#160;I also remember using the thesaurus in Word a lot. &#160;And now I go to dictionary.com or dictionary.google.com exclusively. &#160;The internet seems somehow inherently more flexible, more the creation of human hands, than a musty hard-bound dictionary. &#160;Anyway.<br><br>One disappointing thing: the author presents a story about the origin of the word "quiz" as if it were factual. &#160;(Well, it comes from the mouth of a TV announcer, so maybe we're supposed to acknowledge that they'll say anything that sounds good.) &#160;Anyway, the claim is that "quiz" was invented by one person, the way "frindle" is in the story. &#160;I checked wiki, and according to wiki the story is apocryphal. &#160;So there's that.<br><br>Language seems to spontaneously reject deliberately coined words, like "frindle" in this book. &#160;It's like people don't trust their authenticity, if somebody's consciously trying to make them. &#160;Doesn't seem real. &#160;I can't think of an example of somebody making a word just for the heck of it, like the kid does in this story. &#160;"Quiz" is out.<br><br>The story's logic is consistent with my earlier thoughts about the artificiality of the war between descriptive and prescriptive linguistics. &#160;Parents (teachers) teach their children language, and they teach it the way they learned it. &#160;If they didn't, language would change far too rapidly, with wild creoling every generation or so. &#160;And that's my description of how prescriptivism is an essential part of language.<br><br>Anyway, fun book, reads in about an hour or an hour ten.</div>
