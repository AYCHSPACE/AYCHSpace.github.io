Lesson 1. Do not obey in advance.

Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like
these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government
will want, and then start to do it without being asked. You’ve already
done this, haven’t you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches
authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom.
