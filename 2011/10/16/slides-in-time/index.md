# slides in time (a poem)

<p>some faces slide in time<br>overloading ages in the same<br>moment of observation<br>collapsing to foundations<br>shifting to their children<br>to their parents on and on<br>the labels that are relative<br>to birth or death or both<br>listed simultaneously<br>indiscreet and broadcasting<br>yesterday's formation<br>and tomorrow's formation</p>
