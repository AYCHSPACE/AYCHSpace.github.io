Lesson 5: Be calm when the unthinkable arrives.

When the terrorist attack comes, remember that all authoritarians at
all times either await or plan such events in order to consolidate
power. Think of the Reichstag fire. The sudden disaster that requires
the end of the balance of power, the end of opposition parties, and so
on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book. Donâ€™t fall for it.
