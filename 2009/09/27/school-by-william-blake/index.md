# "The School" by William Blake

<div>
<p>Another poem from the English-language curriculum that I teach...</p>
<div><br></div>
<div><b>The School</b></div>
<div>William Blake</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I love to rise in a summer morn</div>
<div>When the birds sing on every tree;</div>
<div>The distant huntsman winds his horn,</div>
<div>And the sky-lark sings with me.</div>
<div>O! what sweet company!</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>But to go to school in a summer morn,</div>
<div>O! it drives all joy away;</div>
<div>Under a cruel eye outworn</div>
<div>The little ones spend the day</div>
<div>In sighing and dismay.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Ah! then at times I drooping sit,</div>
<div>And spend many an anxious hour;</div>
<div>Nor in my book can I take delight,</div>
<div>Nor sit in learning's bower,</div>
<div>Worn through with the dreary shower.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>How can the bird that is born for joy</div>
<div>Sit in a cage and sing?</div>
<div>How can a child, when fears annoy,</div>
<div>But droop his tender wing,</div>
<div>And forget his youthful spring?</div>
</div>
