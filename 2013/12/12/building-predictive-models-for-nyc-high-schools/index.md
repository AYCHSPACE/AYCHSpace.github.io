# Building Predictive Models for NYC High Schools

<p>I don't have anything to say about building predictive models today myself, but I did want to share this paper from Alec Hubel, which demonstrates some of the really interesting things that you can do even with just the publicly available education data out there on the net.<br>
<br>
Common warnings about correlation vs. causation in education definitely apply, but I think this provides a really neat look at some of the data that NYC makes available. I like it even just for the second figure, which is a simple but rarely seen visualization that makes it easy to explore, by looking, some of the patterns across districts.<br>
<br>
Thanks Alec!<br>
