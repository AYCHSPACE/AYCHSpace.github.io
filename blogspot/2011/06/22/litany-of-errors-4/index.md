# Litany of Errors (4)

<p>I have a couple pages of corrected Korean work still, and I meant to go through it like I had been doing. I leave tasks for my future self like that sometimes. Some of these tasks need to be done, but sometimes these tasks just waste time and keep me from doing the things I really need to be doing. In these cases it can be best to delete the task. In this particular case, I think it would be a mistake to keep revisiting old mistakes. I could be wrong, but I have other things to do.<br><br>I think this sentiment could be expressed eloquently, but that too is not what I really need to spend time on right now.</p>
