# What If? by Randall Munroe

I read this after enjoying [How To][] by the same author. This one is
more directly from the [blog][], which I had only read occasionally.
It's laugh-out-loud funny physics nerdery.

Even when it isn't funny, it explains things in ways that provide
quick understanding:

> "Chemotherapy drugs are blunt instruments. Some are more precisely
> targeted than others, but many simply interrupt cell division in
> general. The reason that this selectively kills cancer cells,
> instead of harming the patient and the cancer equally, is that
> cancer cells are dividing all the time, whereas most normal cells
> divide only occasionally." (page 134)

My only gripe is this apparent inconsistency:

> "Q. How hard would a puck have to be shot to be able to knock the
> goalie himself backward into the net? A. This can't really happen."
> (page 112)

> "If it's going fast enough, a feather can _absolutely_ knock you
> over." page 177

But in general the book seems basically correct in its wild
order-of-magnitude flights of fancy, and it's a darn good time.
