It does seem like some things these days are so bad they can hardly be
made to look worse, and yet far from being stopped, some people really
like them.

So Luyendijk writes about how things in finance are complicated, and
bad, but it's hard to single out any bad guys by name. His Dutch
perspective is interesting: he identifies lack of job security as a
major cause of problems in finance, for example.

On page 254 he has one paragraph of recommendations for law to change
the system:

 1. Break up banks so nothing is too big or too complex to fail
 2. Don't let units of the same company have conflicts of interest
    with one another
 3. Don't allow the building/selling/owning of overly complex
    financial products
 4. Only allow bonuses that have symmetric risk

No problem, right?

The observation and recommendation that resonated the most for me was
reconnecting reward to risk. With big public companies, a trader has
essentially only upside: good performance means a big bonus, but bad
performance means at worst finding another high-paying job at a
different company.

I can get behind the sentiment, at least.
