# Thoughts on listening to The Four-Hour Body (abridged)

<div>
<div class="mobile-photo"></div>The Four-Hour Body<br>Timothy Ferriss<br><br>A friend lent me the abridged audio-book version of this. There were a&#160;lot of things I didn't know when I started listening. I didn't know it&#160;was abridged, although I kind of guessed. Having never seen the cover,&#160;I was quite surprised when he started talking about sex all of a&#160;sudden. I had been expecting just general fitness stuff.<br><br>I also didn't even guess from The title that it was by the same guy as&#160;The Four-Hour Workweek, which I had seen in bookstores. It turns out&#160;that the four hours in the title of this book doesn't mean four hours&#160;per week or anything much really, but seems to be in the title mainly&#160;to reinforce the connection to the successful workweek predecessor.&#160;(It could be interpreted as four hours of exercise per month, as&#160;recommended as thirty minutes twice per week.<br><br>I can't say that the whole method overall seems that time-efficient,&#160;really. Ferris is super OCD, and (was) an insomniac to boot - it seems&#160;like he spends a huge amount of time tweaking and messing with every&#160;little thing he can find. He recommends more crazy weird supplements&#160;than I could even keep track of. Not to mention ice baths and a&#160;low-carb diet he calls "slow carb". Oh, and a bunch of machines and&#160;lights for aiding sleep and so on.<br><br>He does keep it interesting throughout, and I do want to try to&#160;decrease my empty carb calorie intake, which is advice you can hear&#160;anywhere. I may also try his exercise program, which is just based on&#160;doing exercised to (exhaustion) failure, every time, minimizing the&#160;time to failure to a minute or so.<br><br>He also mentioned some supplement for memory that sounded interesting,&#160;but I'd have to check to find the name of it again. And he said there&#160;were nasty side-effects, so maybe I won't even check.&#160;I felt like I was missing things sometimes; transitions were choppy,&#160;or things didn't seem fully explained. I guess that'll be the&#160;abridgment.<br><br>In any event, you can't deny this Ferriss guy is an interesting character.<br><br>---<br><br>Dang, you really CAN get a lot about a book just by looking at the&#160;cover, can't you?<br><br><div class="separator"><a href="photo-797550.JPG"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5582305136552019490" src="photo-797550.JPG"></a></div>
