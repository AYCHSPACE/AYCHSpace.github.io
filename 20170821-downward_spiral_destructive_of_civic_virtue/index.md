# A downward spiral destructive of civic virtue

From page 166 of [Flynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Flynn_(academic))'s [What is intelligence?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_Intelligence%3F):

> Competition for possessions without a rationally imposed limit
> engenders pessimism about acceptance of the restraints necessary to
> avoid ecological disaster.

> Competition for possessions also creates a downward spiral
> destructive of civic virtue. Those who wish to maximize their
> economic status are reluctant to pay taxes and this diminishes state
> provision of health, education, and security against misfortune. As
> the quality of state provision declines, it becomes imperative to
> maximize private wealth for reasons of security even if status
> seeking is set aside. Even principled socialists will pay fees to
> jump the queue for medical care and to get education for their
> children in schools that are not a test of physical survival. The
> more that is true, the more you resent any dollar leaving your
> pocket in tax, so public provision drops further, so willingness to
> be taxed drops further, and so forth. Indeed, since only a few can
> amass the fortune needed to provide self-security, no amount of
> money you can realistically hope to acquire is enough.

I think this passage touches a lot of modern debates.
