<h1>Conceptualizing language for teaching and learning</h1>
<p class="date">Saturday February  5, 2011</p>
<div>
<p>I am thinking about how I understand language, because I want to teach and learn well.<br><br>First, I subscribe generally to something like the Chomskian generative grammar idea of deep structure and surface structure. &#160;I think abstracting to just two structures is a big simplification, and that all the intermediate structures are equally present, and further that the deep structure, if it is taken to be language-specific, is not the deepest structure.<br><br>The brain is doing something, and even if there is no language happening I think it is fair to call what the brain does thinking. &#160;(Maybe if you want to be picky this could be limited to "what the cerebral cortex does," but I think such a division is likely to be artificial.) &#160;Neurons firing hither and thither.<br><br>At some point a thought may start to move up the assembly of language, and make it some or all the way to a final surface form, which may be vocalized or written (or otherwise expressed externally) or not. &#160;Whether or not it is, the machinery of language will (almost?) automatically re-process the surface form, re-understanding what the brain just came up with, allowing it to be re-considered and re-processed, leading to further thought.<br><br>I think this may be the main evolutionary advantage of language over simpler communication systems like grunting, etc. - trumping communication. &#160;Language is good for communication, but for evolutionary purposes it isn't all that much better than non-linguistic communication. &#160;I think the re-processing effect, the feedback loop that you get, may be the prime benefit.<br><br>(could put examples here)<br><br>Anyway, here's a theoretical linguistic stack diagram of the language mechanism:<br></p>
<div class="separator"><a href="ajs20110205lingPic1.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="ajs20110205lingPic1.png"></a></div>And now I'll add my glossing to normal language terms. &#160;I know this isn't perfect. &#160;I think the original divisions aren't perfect either, as semantics is interrelated with the other bits, and you can't really tear them apart neatly. &#160;Anyway, my attempt to go in a useful direction:<br><div class="separator"><a href="ajs20110205lingPic2.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="ajs20110205lingPic2.png"></a></div>I think this could be useful. &#160;I now introduce the following very short story:<br><blockquote>Peter wanted to know the names of the birds.<br>He read a book and learned the names of the birds.<br>Peter wanted to learn how to swim.<br>He read a book and drowned.</blockquote>I don't remember where that's from. &#160;Actually now that I think of it, maybe it was in the back of a Calculus for Dummies book. &#160;Huh. &#160;Anyway, I think it expresses a valuable idea in education.<br><br>I do think that as people become more educated, better readers and thinkers, the bounds of what they can learn from a book expand. &#160;People get good at translating language to action through the faculty of their minds. &#160;Imagination, visualization, that kind of thing. &#160;Most people can learn how to use their clock-radio by reading the instructions. &#160;You don't have to figure it out by messing with the clock. &#160;But even then, you may need some practice to get good. &#160;The point here is that I think about whether certain things are more like swimming or more like bird-naming, for educational purposes.<br><div class="separator"><a href="ajs20110205lingPic3.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="ajs20110205lingPic3.png"></a></div>Okay, so how about this? &#160;I think it can work, with some clarification. &#160;The surface-swimming match seems pretty good to me. &#160;Pronouncing something is a clear skill-performance, and I think it makes sense that it needs to be practiced. &#160;Bird-naming doesn't seem very deep, though.<br><br>Okay, so it's not. &#160;The swimming-style skill of going directly from pre-lingual thought to lingual word is the deep thing here, more or less, and the bird-naming intellectual knowledge, probably stored in a native-language/target-language pair, are clearly different. &#160;However, when trying to bring out that pre-lingual thought in the target language, it's clearly not that hard to go from pre-lingual thought, realize that there's relevant bird-naming knowledge, go to the native language word and then the target language word, and bring it back and finish going to a surface form in the target language. &#160;It is slower, but doing it this way is practice that will develop the relevant swimming-skill. &#160;It's much harder to go from intellectual knowledge of pronunciation to a good performance of the pronunciation skill.<br><br>So maybe the bird-naming / swimming axis would be better understood or labeled as an axis from easily-applied abstract knowledge to practice-immediately-or-you-drown swimming skills. &#160;Maybe it's a fine distinction.<br><br>Compare: In my Korean language program we learned the Korean 'alphabet' / sounds totally without provided romanization, just repeating after the teacher. &#160;The sound systems are different between English and Korean, as you can easily hear if a native English speaker encounters a native Korean speaker who pronounces English words by saying Korean phonetic spellings. &#160;Some vocabulary early on was done with Korean-for-pictures as well, avoiding English glosses, but soon English glosses became very important for understanding and learning Korean vocabulary.<br><br>So this brings me to the traditional four language skills:<br>(Is that the right thing to call them? Language skills?)<br><div class="separator"><a href="ajs20110205lingPic4.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="ajs20110205lingPic4.png"></a></div>Okay that was a silly way to do it, but it looks kind of pretty. &#160;Let's make one of those box diagrams, eh?<br><div class="separator"><a href="ajs20110205lingPic5.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="ajs20110205lingPic5.jpg"></a></div>I'm ignoring the physical parts of reading and writing. &#160;I think that's fair. &#160;They don't use the phonological/pronunciation part of the language stack, anyway.<br><br>So how do people learn these skills, and/or learn a language? &#160;What should teachers do? &#160;What should students do?<br><br><br>Aside: I'm in a particular position of dealing with students who, similar to myself, already have some foundation in the target language. &#160;The foundation may be incomplete, and it may also be incorrect in places. &#160;What is appropriate for this type of student?<br><br>Really I guess the "virgin" student is pretty rare; but I'm thinking about adults who have already had one or more formal treatments of a language...<br><br><br>Okay this is too long already. &#160;Some questions are set up. &#160;Answers: GO!!!</div>
