# Designing Data-Intensive Applications

This book was [recommended](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/march2019) by [Sergey Karayev](https://sergeykarayev.com/) and I agree: this is a very good book.

The [author](https://martin.kleppmann.com/) is expert in both content and communication, erudite and humane. Everyone who works with data would do well to read this book. And it has [maps](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2017/03/15/map-distributed-data-systems.html)!

What is it about? Lots of things... Check out the [table of contents](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/#toc-start). It's so good.
