# Story-time with Aaron: Part 7

<p>(<a href="http://planspace.blogspot.com/2010/04/story-time-with-aaron-part-6.html">Part 6</a>) (<a href="http://planspace.blogspot.com/2010/09/story-time-with-aaron-part-8.html">Part 8</a>)<br><br><br>---<br><br><br>Jesus is unable to find his wallet. Ask him a question.<br><br>"Did you have anything important in it?"<br><br>Lily answers for him. "It's a wallet! Of course there is!"<br><br>Jesus is recalcitrant in contradicting her. "Actually, not all that  much... I spent all my money on lunch. I keep my license at my dad's  shop. Really the only thing in there was my Family Video card."<br><br>Lily is puzzled. "What about your student ID?"<br><br>"I lost that a while ago," Jesus says. "Haven't missed it, really."<br><br>"So the only thing in your wallet is a Family Video card?" asks Lily.  "You don't even need to show your card to rent there. It must be a nice  wallet."<br><br>"It's the one I made out of duct tape in high school," says Jesus. "It was kind of falling apart."<br><br>Lily laughs.</p>
