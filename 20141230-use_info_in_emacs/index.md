# Use Info in Emacs

There is a documentation system accessible from [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) called [Info](https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/). Here's advice from a parenthetical in the [Note for Novices](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eintr.html#Note-for-Novices) of [An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp](www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eintr.html):

> "To learn about Info, type C-h i and then select Info."

Despite using Emacs, off and on, for many years, and also more recently hearing [Sacha Chua](http://sachachua.com/) recommend Info in her [Emacs chats](http://sachachua.com/blog/category/podcast/emacs-chat-podcast/), I had never really used the Info system. But something on [John Cook](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/)'s blog pointed me to the [intro to Emacs Lisp](www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eintr.html) and I started reading it in a web browser until I got to that part:

> "To learn about Info, type C-h i and then select Info."

At that point I did. I went into Emacs and learned about Info, and then I continued working through the [intro to Emacs Lisp](www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eintr.html) inside Emacs, which was a much better way to read it than inside a browser.

I wish I'd come to all this sooner.

If you'd like to try Emacs, you should find it [easy to install](http://planspace.org/20141207-make_it_easy_to_install_emacs/) using [emacs.link](http://emacs.link/). Once you have Emacs open on your computer, do the built-in tutorial. Then:

> "To learn about Info, type C-h i and then select Info."

And then check out the Introduction to Emacs Lisp, also in the Info system.

Have fun!
