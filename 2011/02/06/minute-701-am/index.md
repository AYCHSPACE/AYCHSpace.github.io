<p>Minute 7:01 AM</p>
<p>No, it's a Korean song after all. Just the chorus is in English. It's<br>trendy. It's cool.</p>
<p>Was there a dream back there, somewhere around the seven o'clock<br>chime? Are there snatches of a warm place, or a mystical beast? If<br>there was a dream, now it's all evaporated, just a fog around the<br>verdant mountains that hold in the heat of a subterranean elemental.<br>Here and there inhuman air finds a way in to chill the skin.</p>
<p>Aaron's face is flattened against the pillow, grotesquely deformed and<br>inanimate. The same song plays on.</p>
