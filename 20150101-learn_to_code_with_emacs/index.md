# Learn to Code with Emacs

To [learn to code](/20141231-two_problems_with_learn-to-code_sites/) effectively, use:

 * tools that are actually used for coding
 * materials that are reusable as references

Here's one way to do it:

 1. [Install Emacs](http://emacs.link/).
 2. Do the built-in Emacs Tutorial, accessible from the start screen.
 3. Learn about the Info system (C-h i, select Info).
 4. Work through the Introduction to Programming Emacs Lisp.

These steps will all make sense if you do them in order.

Here's what you get, if you follow the steps above:

 * a powerful editor that you can use with any programming language
 * programming skills together with computer science concepts
 * the ability to use that programming language to enhance that editor

This is a powerful combination, and one that blends seamlessly into further learning and productive work.
