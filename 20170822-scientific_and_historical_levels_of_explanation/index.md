# Scientific and historical levels of explanation

I'm not sure whether an existence claim (about black swans) is the
best example, or whether it matters much if other problems are deeper
or pose paradoxes, but I do think this is an interesting way to phrase
the epistemological difference between a claim supported
experimentally, as by a randomized controlled trial, and a claim based
on observational evidence that is not direct. It's the kind of thing
that I think is worth considering, especially as there seems to be so
much disagreement about how to settle problems.
