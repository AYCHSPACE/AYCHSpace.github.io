# Bad Influence Books

<p>I think it would be really really funny to write some children's books that espouse horrible values. Stories where the hard-working one gets destroyed by chance while the lazy one prospers - that sort of thing. That would be pretty funny. But not funny enough that I really feel like writing such books. I'm not sure that kind of humor is good for kids anyway.</p>
