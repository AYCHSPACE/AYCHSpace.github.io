# Brief thoughts on Simulacron-3

<div>
<p>Simulacron-3<br>Daniel F. Galouye<br><br>I finally FINALLY got a chance to read Simulacron-3 after my <a href="http://paperbackswap.com/">paperbackswap.com</a> request went through. It only took a few years!<br><br>This book is the basis for, among other things, the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139809/">The Thirteenth Floor</a>. It's arguably also the inspiration for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a> and a lot of related thinking. I'd be curious to know if there are proper antecedents to Simulacron-3, beyond abstract philosophers.<br><br>It's interesting reading a book from 1964. The basic idea of simulating a whole world is pretty interesting and modern-feeling, but the gender roles are archaic and computers are basically imagined as bigger versions of that era's, with physical components that you change like a lightbulb and programming basically by wire. And of course there are moving sidewalks everywhere, because that's what we do in the future.<br><br>Two quotes to pull out:<br><br>"You can hardly stuff people into a machine without starting to wonder about the basic nature of both machines and people." (p. 24, and repeated again later)<br><br>"For self-awareness is the only true measure of existence!" (p. 140)<br><br>Interesting that the characters care so little for the people in the simulation within a simulation, when they're so concerned about the people in the first simulation... But I am glad I finally encountered this book in person.<br><br></p>
