# Brain Rules for Baby

To be a good parent, be a good person. The core recommendations on "How to raise a smart and happy child from zero to five" are empathy and understanding emotion.

> "Human learning ... is primarily a relational exercise." (page 111)

Medina aims for objective reasonableness, and it's usually easy for me to agree.

For the abbreviated book (and a few extra nuggets) check out the 15 pages of "practical tips" starting on page 287. Here's my summary of recommendations:

When someone is in an emotional state, use "the empathy reflex" (page 83):

 1. Describe the emotional changes you think you see.
 2. Make a guess as to where those emotional changes come from.

This is like a flip of "[I statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-message)."

After empathy, the second major focus is on understanding emotion: talking about emotions, accepting them as natural, and (eventually) not being ruled by them.

There are lots of concrete recommendations:

 * (During pregnancy) Gain appropriate weight, eat a balanced diet, exercise moderately, reduce stress.
 * Breast-feed for a year.
 * Talk to your baby a lot.
 * Praise effort, not IQ (encourage a growth mindset).
 * Use "authoritative parenting" which is "demanding and warm" and involves:
     * Clear, consistent rules and rewards
     * Swift punishment
     * Rules that are explained
 * (Your child should) Watch no TV before age two.
 * (Your child should) Exercise frequently.
 * (Your child should) Play a lot in open-ended ways, such as the "mature dramatic play" of [Tools of the Mind](https://toolsofthemind.org/), which may involve making a "play plan."
 * (Your child should) Learn sign language.
 * (Your child should) Study a musical instrument for ten years.

Medina gives a very reasonable presentation of intelligence and IQ, including this historical tidbit on how we got the term "Intelligence Quotient" in the first place:

> "The score was the ratio of a child's mental age to his or her chronological age, multiplied by 100. So a 10-year-old who could solve problems normally solved only by 15-year-olds had an IQ of 150: (15/10) X 100." (page 95)

On page 100 we get five ingredients of human intelligence stew, which I like:

 * The desire to explore
 * Self-control
 * Creativity
 * Verbal communication
 * Interpreting nonverbal communication

The associating, questioning, observing, experimenting, and networking from an old Harvard Business Review article on "[Innovators DNA](https://hbr.org/2009/12/the-innovators-dna)" get woven in, and it's not awful.

Three last details I enjoyed:

 * Episodic memory is a distinct kind of memory, and may be particularly useful for creative thinking. (page 106) Maybe consciously draw on it when brainstorming?
 * There's a test of creativity called the [Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrance_Tests_of_Creative_Thinking). (page 107) It's mostly things like "how many uses can you come up with for X?"
 * There's a Harvard-developed test of morality, now at [moralsensetest.com](http://www.moralsensetest.com/). (page 222) It's mostly variations on [the trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem).
