# Wrap-up from DC Hack and Tell #3



I've been putting together these wrap-ups from <a href="http://hackandtell.org/">Hack and Tell</a> in DC for a while now. They go out to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/">meetup</a> list and they're archived <a href="https://github.com/hackandtell/wrapup">on github</a>, but I like them so much I thought I'd put them here too. Working through the back-catalog:

<h2><a href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/">DC Hack and Tell</a></h2>

<h1>

<a class="anchor" href="https://github.com/hackandtell/wrapup/blob/master/dc/2013-11-21.md#round-3-hack-to-the-future" name="user-content-round-3-hack-to-the-future"></a><a href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-Hack-and-Tell/events/149195962/">Round 3: Hack... to the Future!</a>

</h1>

And now, a wrap-up... in random order!

<ul class="task-list">

	<li>Mike showed the excellent&#160;<a href="http://www.audioverb.com/">audioverb</a>&#160;for all your language in situ needs - and it even has a&#160;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8dx6EBKpTE">youtube explanation</a>&#160;too!</li>

	<li>Aaron talked about&#160;<a href="https://github.com/ajschumacher/rjstat">rjstat</a>, his R package for reading and writing the&#160;<a href="http://json-stat.org/">JSON-stat</a>&#160;data format.</li>

	<li>Fearless leader Jonathan shared a classic Hack and Tell hack for decoding cryptograms using simple language models and SIMULATED ANNEALING! (I know, right?) It's called&#160;<a href="https://github.com/jhalcrow/cryptosolver">cryptosolver</a>. We miss you, Jonathan!</li>

	<li>Bayan showed how to simulate fantasy football drafts/seasons in R to test theories and impress your friends! With a&#160;<a href="http://prezi.com/wthgy9h1mizn/fantasy-hack/">Prezi</a>!</li>

	<li>Tom presented not just the JS live-coding&#160;<a href="http://mistakes.io/">mistakes.io</a>&#160;but also&#160;<a href="http://macwright.org/play-statistics/">super fun interactive statistics</a>&#160;and&#160;<a href="http://macwright.org/simple-statistics/">simple-statistics</a>!</li>

	<li>Aaron also showed this&#160;<a href="http://ajschumacher.github.io/perplexity/">Guess the Letter</a>&#160;thing. Oh my gosh there's a&#160;<a href="http://planspace.org/2013/09/23/perplexity-what-it-is-and-what-yours-is/">blog post</a>.</li>

</ul>

And there will be even more good stuff coming soon... to the future!
