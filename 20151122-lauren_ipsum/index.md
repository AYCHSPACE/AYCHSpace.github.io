# Lauren Ipsum

I finally read a copy of [Lauren Ipsum](http://www.laurenipsum.org/) that I had lying around, wanting to read it before giving it away when I go talk at a school as part of their upcoming [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/) festivities.

I liked it so much, I gave my initial copy to a friend who teaches computer science, and I'm getting three more copies to give away at that school and as gifts to others.

I agree with the Phantom Tollbooth [comparison](http://boingboing.net/2014/12/29/lauren-ipsum-the-phantom-toll.html). The writing is dense at multiple scales with fun computer science concepts, references, and wordplay, from the value of elegant design, to forests of [red-black trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree), to optimizing away literal [tails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call). I laughed out loud.
