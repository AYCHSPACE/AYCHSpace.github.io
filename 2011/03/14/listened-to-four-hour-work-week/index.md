# Listened to The Four-Hour Work Week

<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span">The Four-Hour Work Week</span><span class="Apple-style-span"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span">Timothy Ferriss</span><span class="Apple-style-span"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span">I got this as an audiobook in anticipation of keeping my eyes closed&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">for a long time after getting LASIK on Saturday. Turns out they wanted&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">me to keep my eyes open mostly, and just do a lot of blinking. Whatev.&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">Still listened to it over the weekend.</span><span class="Apple-style-span"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span">Here's the secret of the four-hour work week: start a business selling&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">something, outsource almost everything (manufacture, shipping,&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">customer service, everything) and just take the profit. So I guess&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">it's not much of a secret; if you start a successful business then the&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">rest is easy. He claims his method works for employees to, and&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">advocates arranging to telecommute and then be wildly efficient so&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">that it doesn't take much time. So if you can do a full week's work in&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">four hours, again, no problem.</span><span class="Apple-style-span"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span">It does have some fairly neat ideas, to be sure. There may be a time&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">when I want to hire a personal assistant in India or whatever. That&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">time is not now, but heh.</span><span class="Apple-style-span"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span">After listening to the abridged Four-Hour Body, I got this book&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">unabridged. Problem: that includes the lists of references at the end&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">of nearly every chapter. It is so boring listening to the guy go&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">"double-u double-u double-u" four million times in a row.&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">"forward-slash ess forward-slash"... Not good for the audiobook&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">format.</span><span class="Apple-style-span"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span">In the end it's kind of slap-dash entrepreneurism, with one issue&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">being that for you to have the four-hour work week lifestyle requires&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">a slew of people working normal lots-of-work jobs. And in my case,&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">there's really no way to change the nature of my teaching job to&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">require less time. I have to be physically there leading the class -&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">that's the whole point of the job. So while I may consider using some&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">of he tactics in the future, Ferriss's approach seems largely to be&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">about gaming the system, and almost feels somehow unethical.</span><span class="Apple-style-span"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span">Actually, I think my gut feeling is more like this: Ferris is just&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">kind of a shmuck. He's just interested in doing things, not in doing&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">them well, or right. I get that impression watching video of him. I&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">get that impression of him writing about "conversational fluency" in&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">language learning. I get that impression reading about how he won a&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">martial arts competition by gaming the rules, not by being really&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">skilled. So while I admire a lot of what he's accomplished, I don't&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">know if I could really say that I want to be like him. I do want to be&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">more jump-in-and-try-without-fear-</span><span class="Apple-style-span"><wbr></wbr></span><span class="Apple-style-span">of-failure like him, but it seems&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">like he exaggerates his accomplishments too much without really being&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">all that substantial. He reminds me of some people I used to work&#160;</span><span class="Apple-style-span">with.</span><span class="Apple-style-span"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><br></span><span class="Apple-style-span">Pretty cool ideas about travel though. Advice I'd like to take there.</span><br><span class="Apple-style-span"><br></span><br><div class="separator"><a href="photo.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="photo.JPG"></a></div>
