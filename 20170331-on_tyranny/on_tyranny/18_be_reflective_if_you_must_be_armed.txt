Lesson 18: Be reflective if you must be armed.

If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you.
But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers
finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to say
no. (If you do not know what this means, contact the United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum and ask about training in professional
ethics.)
