<h1>TMS: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</h1>
<p class="date">Sunday November  7, 2010</p>
<div>
<p>I was a volunteer in several fMRI studies when I was in college. &#160;It's cool to get a picture of your brain, but I think most people know about, if not functional MRI, at least MRI generally as a medical diagnosis tool.<br><br>Just exactly once I was a volunteer in a study that used TMS, and I keep thinking that it is so cool and so relatively unknown that I should write something about it.<br><br></p>

<div>Not me, but I probably looked pretty similar.</div>
<br>Just as the name says, in Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation they use electromagnets outside your head to stimulate brain activity, which is basically electrical, inside your skull. &#160;It's effectively similar to putting an electrode into your brain, without the hassle of cutting your whole head open. &#160;Maybe you've heard of the studies where they stick an electrode into somebody's brain, and he starts to see butterflies and stuff. &#160;It's like that, but without sticking things in.<br><br>IT IS BASICALLY TOTAL BRAIN CONTROL and that is pretty cool.<br><br>When I did it I didn't see any&#160;hallucinations&#160;or anything. &#160;They were targeting my motor cortex. &#160;They made my left pinky move, as I recall (this was several years ago). &#160;It doesn't feel unnatural or anything; your pinky just moves, just like if you wanted it to.<br><br>So long story short, this is pretty much the coolest thing ever. &#160;The experience dramatically shows the extent to which your body/brain is just a machine.<br><br>I guess they use TMS for some medical treatments too. Whatev. &#160;Read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation">wiki</a> if you want.</div>
