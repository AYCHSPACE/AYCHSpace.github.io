# Is it worth doing even if it fails?

Many things can "succeed" or "fail." Avoid anything that isn't worth
doing even if it fails.

If two tasks each have a probability of success and payout, but one is
worth doing regardless of success and one is only about payout, it
almost doesn't matter what the probabilities and payouts are. One
guarantees a good use of time.

This filter also averts unhealthy fixation on "winning" and excessive
disappointment with "losing." It lets you focus on the task itself,
which is the right focus.

You can't always choose what you have to do. But you can try to find
or create value even in endeavors you wouldn't otherwise choose.

Asking "Is it worth doing even if it fails?" encourages healthy things
like sports, discourages antisocial things like fraud, and provides a
positive direction to move everything in between. I think it's a
useful question.

<!-- In "Daring Greatly," Brené Brown asks "What’s worth doing even if
I fail?" I discovered this while preparing this post, and I thought
about mentioning it, but it isn't really a focus for Brown and in the
end I didn't think it would improve my little post to go into some
sort of "related work" section. -->
