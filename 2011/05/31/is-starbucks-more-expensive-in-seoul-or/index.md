I could get 300 won off when I brought my own mug/tumbler/whatever, and I could get the extra shot free with my Starbucks card (500 won).<br><br>In LA, I just paid $3.40 for my double tall latte. That includes the extra shot, which rings up at $0.75 somehow. It's possible to get $0.10 off when you bring your own mug here.<br><br>At an exchange rate (current today, 2011.5.31) of 1078 won to the dollar, that means that with no discounts we have:<br><br>LA: $3.40<br>Seoul: $4.27<br><br>for a double tall latte, making Seoul's Starbucks considerably more expensive, with no discounts applied. Even with all the discounts, the Seoul price is still $3.52; and the LA price could be as low as $3.30, and just $2.65 with the normal amount of shots.<br><br>So the answer is, at least for tall lattes:<br><br></p>
