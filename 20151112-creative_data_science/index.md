Here are some questions the audience was asked to answer and discuss before things got rolling:

 * What are you reading?
 * What is your favorite tool, process, or technique for your work?
 * What is your _least_ favorite tool, process, or technique for your work?
 * What was the last new tool, process, or technique you learned (or are currently learning)?
 * What would you like to learn next?
