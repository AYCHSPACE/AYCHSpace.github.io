# Static Site Wish List

drafted 2014-08-15 (?)

I want these things:

 * Markdown source
 * Edit button everywhere
 * MathJax
 * Dynamic live editing on my machine
 * Static HTML generation for publication
 * Hostable via gh-pages
 * No install (all code lives in same repo as markdown and generated HTML)
 * Comments?
 * Preserves idea of "publication" regardless of other editing, including publication date
