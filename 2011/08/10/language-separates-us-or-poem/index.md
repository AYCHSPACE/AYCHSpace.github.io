# Language Separates Us, or "â™¡" (a poem)

<p>They say scent is tightly linked to memory
<br>and they say it with words
<br>is it any wonder
<br>
<br>On a road home the manure smell is heavy
<br>with that of freshly cut grass
<br>from cows so wealthy
<br>
<br>The process of language in and language out
<br>does not digest reality
<br>while the nose is subconscious
<br>
<br>I looked her in the eye, her right to my left
<br>and felt certain she knew
<br>what I saw
<br>
<br>Those eyes were etched and buried deep
<br>with inexpressible conviction
<br>solidarity and solitude
<br>
<br>As every song I hear I sing
<br>begets a meaning just for me
<br>contradictory and comforting
<br>
<br>Language separates us from other animals, they say
<br>like skyscrapers and spiders and Twitter and orangutans
<br>language holds us apart</p>
