# Practical Statistics for Data Scientists, 2nd Edition

I was happy to do a pre-publication technical review of the upcoming
[second edition][] of this fine book by three folks including the
founder of [statistics.com][]. The book has a unique perspective
enlivened by examples and historical detail, which I enjoyed.
