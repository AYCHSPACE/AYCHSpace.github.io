# "Ethics" by Linda Pastan

<p>I like this poem, which was included in the curriculum of one of the upper-level English (language) classes I teach.  So I'll keep it here.</p>

<div><b>Ethics</b></div>
<div>Linda Pastan</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>In ethics class so many years ago</div>
<div>our teacher asked this question every fall:</div>
<div>if there were a fire in a museum</div>
<div>which would you save, a Rembrandt painting</div>
<div>or an old woman who hadn't many</div>
<div>years left anyhow?  Restless on hard chairs</div>
<div>caring little for pictures or old age</div>
<div>we'd opt one year for life, the next for art</div>
<div>and always half-heartedly.  Sometimes</div>
<div>the woman borrowed my grandmother's face</div>
<div>leaving her usual kitchen to wander</div>
<div>some drafty, half-imagined museum.</div>
<div>One year, feeling clever, I replied</div>
<div>why not let the woman decide herself?</div>
<div>Linda, the teacher would report, eschews</div>
<div>the burdens of responsibility.</div>
<div>This fall in a real museum I stand</div>
<div>before a real Rembrandt, old woman,</div>
<div>or nearly so, myself.  The colors</div>
<div>within the frame are darker than autumn,</div>
<div>darker even than winter - the browns of the earth,</div>
<div>though earth's most radiant elements burn</div>
<div>through the canvas.  I know now that woman</div>
<div>and painting and season are almost one</div>
<div>and all beyond saving by children.</div>
