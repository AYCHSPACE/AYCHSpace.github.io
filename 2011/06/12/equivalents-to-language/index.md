# Equivalents to language

<p>I suspect that, in a way similar to that in which a bunch of things are equivalent to Turing machines, a lot of things will turn out to be equivalent to having human language. Probably consciousness is in there. I'm not formulating this super well, and I think there was another thing that I wanted to include in my speculative set of things, but I think there may be something to this, eventually.</p>
