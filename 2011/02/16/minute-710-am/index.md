<p>Minute 7:10 AM</p>
<p>The sound of his phone vibrating reaches Aaron's exposed ear, gets<br>modeled in his head by chemicals. Just timeless moments ago the same<br>signal had arrived. But then it was with those drums, accompanied.<br>That meant it was an alarm. That meant it deserved the same response<br>as a mosquito. Extinguishing.</p>
<p>This is just one vibration. Night Aaron didn't plan this. Trip-wires<br>are snapping across the unconscious wilderness in the dark. What could<br>cause this. It could be a text message. But it's early. Who would do<br>that? Is it Aaron's boss? His teacher? His classmate? Those could be<br>dealt with effectively by further sleeping, maybe.</p>
<p>It could be a text message from that girl, that one who used to send<br>pleasant text messages, up until not so long ago. The deer in the<br>subconscious pick up their heads and smell the air. The conscious mind<br>whirrs into action. Rotate head. Eyes open. The blue box floating over<br>the clock radio blinks out. Too late. Couldn't see what it said.</p>
<p>But it could be that girl.</p>
