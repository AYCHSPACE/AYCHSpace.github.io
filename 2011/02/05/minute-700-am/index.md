# Minute 7:00 AM

<p>Minute 7:00 AM</p>
<p>The clock radio is just a few seconds late, so it comes on after the<br>official broadcast chime that marks seven o'clock.</p>
<p>"Just like a happy Christmas," sings a voice, out of tune with the<br>season. They play a lot of English language songs on Korean radio.</p>
<p>"Hmph," sings a voice, out of a blanket and pillow. This is not a<br>word, not in English, not in Korean. But what it means is, "I am not<br>quite all here yet."</p>
