Weirdnesses:

 * Five dashes ("-----") start and end slides that get made into
   [big][] slides in `big/`. Still rendered as horizontal rules
   otherwise.
 * Uses standard Python markdown processing, but custom pre-processed
   to support GitHub-style fenced code blocks.

Syntax highlighting is by [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/download/). It's a custom pack; right now these are the languages:

 * Bash
 * Python
 * R
 * JSON
 * HTML/XML
