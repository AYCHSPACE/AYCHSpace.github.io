# Art is Art: Two Galleries

<br>I went to see Edward Tufte's gallery, ET Modern, at 547 West 20th Street. He's a sort of demigod of data visualization. Now he does art such as the above, which announces that "ART IS ART / AND EVERYTHING ELSE / IS EVERYTHING ELSE".<br><br>To get to ET Modern, I walked by the Jack Shainman Gallery at 513 West 20th Street.&#160;It looked interesting.&#160;I went in. It was showing a collection of work by Hank Willis Thomas called "What goes without saying".<br><br><div class="separator"><a href="photo+4.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="photo+4.JPG"></a></div>
<br>Those are hand-painted blow-ups of old button designs. I explored these and other works, and then I went on to ET Modern to see Tufte's aluminum Feynman diagrams.<br><br><div class="separator"><a href="photo+2.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="photo+2.JPG"></a></div>
<br>Tufte has made quite a lot of these aluminum Feynman diagrams. Some of them are hung like this, which brought to mind the most memorable thing I think I've ever overheard at a modern art museum:<br><blockquote class="tr_bq">Now this, this would go well with my sofa.</blockquote>
<br>I do like Feynman diagrams quite a lot, to be sure. After I had gone to the two galleries once, I went back to "What goes without saying" to check it out again.<br><br><div class="separator"><a href="photo+3.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="photo+3.JPG"></a></div>
<br>The second time at this gallery, I happened on a group that was being led by the artist himself, Hank Willis Thomas. It was a group of students whose professor knew the artist. I joined the group and felt welcome enough. Mr. Thomas talked about his work, something about his intent, his process, what he thought was good and interesting about various things - it was very nice. His work is not necessarily suitable for hanging over couches at country clubs. His work is communicative. It is emotional. It is meaningful. I am afraid my photo does not capture it very well. His work bears close examination. It bears consideration and reflection. At the very least, it has something to say.<br><br>I went to ET Modern once more to get a last picture. As I was leaving I asked the man who sat at a desk by the door, selling Tufte's books and things from the kind of ersatz gift shop there, why there was a big red "emergency stop" button by the exit. His explanation was a bit awkward, but he did demonstrate to me that it was completely non-functional, a kind of cartoon joke on the wall. What he said was, "It stops customers who don't buy things here."<br><br>I did think some about Tufte's work. "ART IS ART / &#160;AND EVERYTHING ELSE / IS EVERYTHING ELSE" - I was more than a little tempted to declare that Tufte's work falls clearly on one side of that division, and that Thomas' work falls on the other. But there is still a lot to like in Tufte's work, his books, even his art.<br><br><div class="separator"><a href="photo+1.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="photo+1.JPG"></a></div>
<br>"IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT"</div>
