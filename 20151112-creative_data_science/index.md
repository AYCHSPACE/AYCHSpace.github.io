# Creative Data Science

*A “Chalk Talk” “Brown Bag Lunch” for the [World Bank Group](http://www.worldbank.org/) IFC ([International Finance Corporation](http://www.ifc.org/)) RMES ([Results, Measurement and Evaluation Stream](http://red-sphere.com/clients/WBG/video/index.html)) on Thursday November 12, 2015. ([slides](big.html))*

This is the flyer the World Bank folks made:

![flyer](flyer.png)

Here are some questions the audience was asked to answer and discuss before things got rolling:

 * What are you reading?
 * What is your favorite tool, process, or technique for your work?
 * What is your _least_ favorite tool, process, or technique for your work?
 * What was the last new tool, process, or technique you learned (or are currently learning)?
 * What would you like to learn next?

Hi! I'm Aaron. This is my blog and [my twitter handle](https://twitter.com/planarrowspace). You can get from one to the other. [This presentation](big.html) and a corresponding write-up (you're reading it) are on my blog (which you're on).

I was invited to give a talk about “the data scientist's toolbox”.

A lot of people, when they hear “the data scientist's toolbox”, think of some programming language, or some particular suite of implementations like Hadoop or Spark.

Here's a tool!

It's the AlexNet deep convolutional neural network, which was state of the art for identifying things in images a couple years ago. We could use an implementation from the Model Zoo on Caffe, which would probably still have the 11-by-11 convolutions on the first layer, but likely wouldn't split the computation across two GPUs that way, yadda yadda yadda, this kind of thing is relevant to some of the work my current company is doing, yadda yadda yadda.

This might be interesting for some people, but for a lot of people I suspect it would not be.

“Be regular and orderly in your life so that you may be violent and original in your work.”

I came across this [Flaubert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Flaubert) quote [somewhere](http://planspace.org/2014/01/19/daily-rituals-is-sort-of-inspiring/), and I like it quite a lot.

The tools I'm focusing on help me to be regular and orderly in my everyday work.

Being regular and orderly in everyday work means that everyday work becomes easier, leaving capacity for more sophisticated work.

From the other side, even if your work is very sophisticated, you still have to attend to the everyday, and life will be better if it is well attended.

What's more important to the painting, the painter or the brush?

Certainly you need both, and tools are more or less a requirement everywhere. But the mental tools, the skills and experience of the painter, these make the lion's share of the difference in the end results.

I haven't taught painting, but I've taught “data science tools” for a number of years, and my overwhelming impression has been that mental tools matter more than the particular software people happen to use.

The good news is that while you may not always be able to choose your tools, you can always choose (and improve) the self that you bring to them!

The first question I asked earlier (“What are you reading?”) may have seemed not to be about tools, but it is. Reading builds you new tools.

Here's what I'm currently reading: a book called “Debugging Teams”. Good book!

You have a great team here at the World Bank, and I want to point out that you're doing a great thing today, taking your lunch to become even greater. That's exactly the kind of thing that strong teams do.

-----

A central point of “Debugging Teams” is the importance of humility, respect, and trust.

In that spirit, let me describe a best-case scenario for our time together:

I will mostly tell you about other people's ideas. (And I may not always cite sources.)

Worse, I probably won't even have quite the right ideas for you.

I'm going to talk about some things that I think help create good work with data.

But I sure don't have your expertise, experience, and other knowledge about everything that you're working on.

This kind of event doesn't make sense if it's just me talking and then everybody goes back to working exactly the same as they always do.

You've come together in this safe collaborative space. The people who should get something out of it are you. What will you go on to do that you wouldn't have done if you weren't in this room today? This is a chance for you to think up something great! It could be the opposite of what I suggest, or totally unrelated. Today could be the day you have that great idea that saves the world!

Create!

[demo]

-----

This next bit is a kind of game.

I'm going to do a demonstration with Excel, which I understand some of you have seen before, and I want you to evaluate what I do.

It's as simple as "Aaron did X, and it was good (or bad) because Y."

After I finish, we'll discuss in pairs and try to get a list of twelve such evaluations.

Discussion!

 * good things?
 * bad things?
 * WWYD?

-----

That's "What Would You Do".
