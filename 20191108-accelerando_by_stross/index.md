# Accelerando, by Stross

[Accelerando][] was referenced in [Issue 169][] of the [Import AI][]
newsletter. The Accelerando ebook is available [for free][], along
with [the author][]'s charming story of how the book came to be.
Accelerando is a reasonably fun, wacky romp through the
[technological singularity][].

Bits of the story, such as the space lobster AI, have an absurdist
element along the lines of [Hitchhiker's Guide][]. A difference is
that Accelerando has more connections to actual science and
technology: different kinds of reminders of how strange reality can
be.

The book was born in the late 90s, published as short stories, and
finally released as a novel in 2005. Now, after the rise and
(arguable) fall of [Google Glass][], among other things, it's
interesting to consider how progress toward this imagining of the
singularity is going.

The likes of [DeepMind][] and [OpenAI][] keep announcing new results,
but the last 5% of the driverless car problem still seems hard.
Language models are good enough to [improve Google search][], but
don't really seem to be moving toward [AGI][]. Some kind of progress
is being made, but it isn't always clear how much any particular
advance moves us toward specific long-term goals.

Is technology making people more productive? In the rich world, it
sometimes feels like it might be doing the opposite, on average.
Fiction loves a [great personality][], but I can't really see
canonizing folks who are automating content farms, for example.

The book has dystopian elements, perhaps from the over-association of
tech startup culture and singularity theorizing. Corporate structures
become sentient. Legal battles and financial concerns still command a
surprising amount of attention in the post-scarcity future of
Accelerando.

Also typical of fiction, the book keeps you wondering what's going to
happen. Somewhat atypically, the premise is that the world changes so
much that humans can't understand it any more, so by definition the
book can't deliver a satisfying conclusion, in some respects.

The characters have more sexuality than personality, but if you can
ignore that and [the transporter problem][] you get to upload your
brain to a tiny [light sail][] starship and watch a [Dyson sphere][]
get built. Could be worse.
