# Exhalation by Ted Chiang

[Ted Chiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang) wrote [Story of Your Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life), which I liked a lot and became the movie [Arrival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)). [Exhalation](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/538034/exhalation-by-ted-chiang/9781101947883/) has two more single-timeline [deterministic](https://samharris.org/books/free-will/) time-travel stories at the beginning, but then it opens up a bit. Chiang's [first collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stories_of_Your_Life_and_Others) might be better, but read this one too.

Spoilers as I briefly describe Exhalation's stories:

 * The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate
     * Single-timeline time-travel with portals that can take you
       whenever they existed.
 * Exhalation
     * Entropy kills (but also some neat stuff on trying to understand
       brains).
 * What's Expected of Us
     * Oh man there's no free will.
 * The Lifecycle of Software Objects
     * Humanlike AI requires humanlike entities. I tend to agree with
       his take here.
 * Dacey's Patent Automatic Nanny
     * Some kid develops an attachment to machines rather than people.
 * The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling
     * Let's understand Trump as pre-literate / maybe perfect (video)
       memory is cool?
 * The Great Silence
     * Maybe parrots are really smart?
 * Omphalos
     * A world with physical proof of creationism finds out it was
       God's practice planet.
 * Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom
     * Devices for communicating between two parallel universes (one
       pair per device).

I never wrote about [Stories of Your Life and Others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stories_of_Your_Life_and_Others), so I'll describe those too:

 * Tower of Babylon
     * It gets so high that it breaks through the firmament.
 * Understand
     * A guy gets crazy smart and fights with another smart guy.
 * Division by Zero
     * Whoa what if arithmetic is
       [inconsistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency).
 * Story of Your Life
     * Cross-time awareness (single timeline) with aliens and writing.
 * Seventy-Two Letters
     * What if people really did grow from
       [homunculi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus) (also
       other weird stuff).
 * The Evolution of Human Science
     * People make more advanced humans and we can't understand them
       any more. (Possible connection to AI explainability?)
 * Hell is the Absence of God
     * A world where angels are real and messy, heaven and hell are
       real, etc.
 * Liking What You See: A Documentary
     * Turning off visual perception of human beauty.
