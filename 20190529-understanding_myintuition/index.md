# Understanding MyinTuition

[MyinTuition](https://myintuition.org/) is a simple online college
cost estimator for about 50 schools. I was curious about how it
worked, so I figured it out. I suspect they don't want me to say, and
I like them, so I won't. But here are some of my opinions and
experiences.

The rhetoric around MyinTuition is all about transparency, as in the
creator's 2014 paper about it, [Transparency in College Costs][paper].
They want to be transparent about this message:
[Top Colleges Are Cheaper Than You Think (Unless Youâ€™re Rich)][nyt].

College affordability is important. An expanded idea of transparency
might further include how the MyinTuition calculations are done, and
how the different schools vary. That's what I was curious about.

I originally thought I'd try to use machine learning to understand how
MyinTuition works, which would mean first collecting training data.
I'm not sure this was ever a good idea. For one thing, it doesn't seem
practical if data collection is severely rate-limited.

I explored on and off for a couple months. It was fun! It wouldn't be
as much fun to do now, what with the [CAPTCHA][captcha]s they've put
in. And unfortunately it may no longer be possible to access
MyinTuition at all using the IP addresses I was on at the time.

Figuring out the MyinTuition calculations and parameters for different
schools was interesting. I'll just recommend that you try a bunch of
schools and see what you get. You can find the calculators for all
participating schools [on their site][list].

Never stop learning, kids!
