# Simple isn't Easy

[Nick Patterson](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/nick-patterson) of the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) was on a recent [episode](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/blog/2016/2/26/ai-safety-and-the-legacy-of-bletchley-park) of the [Talking Machines](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/) podcast. He said some things that seemed right to me.

First, he said:

> I think the most important thing to do on data analysis is to do the simple things right.

I agree. I think that in a field where people are excited about complicated algorithms and flashy visuals, the importance of "fundamentals" is too often neglected.

He also said:

> The smarter you are the less likely you are to make a stupid mistake.

I think this is related to the above, but not necessarily only or even primarily about intelligence. I think it also has to do with humility, thoroughness, responsibility, and experience, at least.
