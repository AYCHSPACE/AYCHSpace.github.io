# Bad Data Handbook: Quite Good



Preparing for an upcoming <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Data-Wranglers-DC/events/154160282/">talk</a>, I thought I'd read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bad-Data-Handbook-Cleaning-Back/dp/1449321887">this book</a>:

(You can <a href="http://it-ebooks.info/book/1263/">find</a> this book online for free - is that legit?)

I like this book quite a lot. It's a collection of chapters by different authors, and reads something like a series of excellent blog posts. With the exception of chapter 18, it's quite good. It covers a lot of the issues that arise in practice when gathering and starting to work with data. The explanation of text encoding in chapter 4 could be the best I've seen, and chapter 14 ("myths of cloud computing") is something I wish a lot of people who present themselves as "cloud experts" would read and understand. Philipp K. Janert, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Analysis-Open-Source-Tools/dp/0596802358/">Data Analysis with Open Source Tools</a>, contributes a very nice chapter as well.

The book closes with a "framework" for data quality, with these "four Cs":

<ul>

	<li>Complete</li>

	<li>Coherent</li>

	<li>Correct</li>

	<li>aCcountable</li>

</ul>

It's not bad, this book. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs to work with data in the real world. I think there's room for even more theory and practice of data cleaning; I'd like to see an even better book yet!
