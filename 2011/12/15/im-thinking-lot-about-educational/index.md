# Thinking about educational technology

<div>
<p>I'm thinking a lot about educational technology and continuing the experiments I began with a rather dry implementation at <a href="http://www.naldaramjui.com/TOPIK">naldaramjui.com</a>. This <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/7-key-questions-to-ask-about-ed-technology-online-learning/2011/12/14/gIQAZ8XouO_blog.html">article</a>&#160;(from The Washington Post's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet">Answer Sheet</a> blog, one of the most consistently good sources of interesting educational perspectives I know of) really puts in words a lot of my thoughts - especially this:<br><br></p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<b><i>What is happening in the classroom that could not be duplicated by a computer?</i></b>&#160;<br>If the answer is &#8220;nothing,&#8221; then there is a problem.&#160; In fact, I believe that if teachers can be replaced by computers, they should be.&#160; By that I mean if a teacher offers nothing that your child can&#8217;t get from a computer screen, then your child might as well be learning online.&#160; On the other hand, no screen will ever replace a creative, engaged, interactive, relevant, and inspiring teacher, especially one who takes advantage of the precious face-to-face experience of people learning together.&#160;Collective, communal, collaborative learning is key to many of the ways we all work now, often in collaborative and distributed ways.&#160;&#160; How is the school working to teach real, human, management, leadership, and collaborative skills in the unique environment of the classroom?</blockquote>
