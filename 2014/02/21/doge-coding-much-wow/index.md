# doge coding: much wow


I have recently come across two more or less <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge">doge</a>-titled educational resources for coding. This definitely constitutes a trend.

First up is <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</a>. I'm pretty sure the title includes the exclamation point. It's a free book about <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, of course. (You can also buy it if you want.)

Last up is <a href="https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode">Learn You The Node.js For Much Win!</a>. Same deal with the exclamatory title. This one is a command-line interactive tutorial about <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> that runs on <a href="https://github.com/rvagg/workshopper">workshopper</a>. I found out about this after first hearing about a similar thing for <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> called <a href="https://github.com/jlord/git-it">git-it</a>.

I, for one, would love to see these somehow form the basis for an entire line of amusingly titled "Learn you" books (and so on).
