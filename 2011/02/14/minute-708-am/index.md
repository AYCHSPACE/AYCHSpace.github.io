<p>Minute 7:08 AM</p>
<p>Night Aaron is in there somewhere, struggling somehow to preserve<br>continuity. Wrapped in blankets, wrapped in folds of unconscious mind,<br>he will reassert himself eventually, more or less the same person as<br>yesterday and the day before.</p>
<p>Night Aaron thinks getting up early will be good for morning Aaron,<br>but it isn't all virtue and grace for night Aaron either. Night Aaron<br>left a bowl and fork in the bathroom and shower stall, filled with<br>water to loosen the curry sauce. Night Aaron didn't want to go to the<br>shared kitchen on the floor to wash it; morning Aaron can wash the<br>dishes while he showers. The bowl and fork are visible from the<br>laundry piled at the head of the bed, just in front of the book shelf,<br>through an open transparent door in the translucent wall divider to<br>the shower, the same space as the toilet.</p>
<p>Night Aaron left two more socks in that pile, but it's morning Aaron,<br>or one of his descendants, who'll have to wash everything. Night Aaron<br>can be a real jerk too. Morning Aaron doesn't feel too bad about lying<br>in bed - or wouldn't, if he was feeling anything at all.</p>
