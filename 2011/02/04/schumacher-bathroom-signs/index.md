# Schumacher Bathroom Signs

<div>
<p>I had this idea a while ago and I felt like mocking it up on the computer finally today.  Now I'm a graphic designer!  Bwa-ha-ha.<br></p>
<div class="separator"><a href="ajs20110205Bathroom+signs+screen+shot.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="ajs20110205Bathroom+signs+screen+shot.png"></a></div>The shapes represent gender equality in that they have exactly the same surface area, if I made them right.  Of course they're also sort of over-simplified anatomical diagrams, which I think is a little funny.  In case it's not obvious, I used the traditional gender-stereotyped colors, and for this post I stuck M and W underneath to make it painfully clear.<br><br>So now we don't have to imply that all women wear skirts in order for people to find their way to the appropriate segregated restroom!  It's all biology, baby!  I would love to see these symbols on bathroom doors around the world, hahaha...</div>
