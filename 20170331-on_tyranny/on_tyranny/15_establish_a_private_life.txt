Lesson 15: Establish a private life.

Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around.
Scrub your computer of malware. Remember that email is skywriting.

any legal trouble. Authoritarianism works as a blackmail state,
looking for the hook on which to hang you. Try not to have too many
hooks.
